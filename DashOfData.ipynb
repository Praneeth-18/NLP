              " '“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”',\n",
              " '“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.',\n",
              " '“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.',\n",
              " '“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”',\n",

Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.',\n",

If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.',\n",

This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time.

People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”',\n",

It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”',\n",

You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.',\n",

Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on!

That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends.

Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.',\n",

It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program.

In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes.

You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.',\n",

I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row.

It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\\u2019s 22 years old. He\\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you\\u2019re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE! Welcome to the show this is Bo, this is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this. Welcome to the show, this is Bo this is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this. Play an invisible drum.

Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?

Please leave.\\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \\u201cHello, Bo!\\u201d \\u2018I\\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe.

[Screeching] It\\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\\u2019s a hint. He\\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \\u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\\u2019re having fun\\u2026 This, um- This show is called \\u201cwhat\\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical. Aware of patterns. [Robotic voice] Aware of trends. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s efficient. [Robotic voice] And a prick. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s right brain. [Robotic voice] Subjective. Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That\\u2019s your opinion\\u2026 So just\\u2026 Be careful with opinions\\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \\u201cYou\\u2019re incomparable.\\u201d \\u201cLike a \\u2026 \\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\\u201d \\u201cI want to grab one of those\\u201d \\u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\\u201d \\u201cand bash your rib cage in!\\u201d \\u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\\u201d \\u201cbind them with a rubber band\\u201d \\u201cstick the lead in your mouth\\u201d \\u201cand punch the erasers!\\u201d \\u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\\u201d \\u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\\u201d \\u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\\u201d \\u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\\u201d \\u201cI want you to somehow survive\\u201d \\u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\\u201d \\u201cnot survive a small fender bender\\u201d \\u201con the way back from a hospital.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\\u2019s called \\u201cDad\\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \\u201cOh no!\\u201d \\u201cSound the alarm!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not appealing\\u201d \\u201cto little girls\\u201d \\u201cwho don\\u2019t have arms.\\u201d But they can\\u2019t use iTunes, so\\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody! [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 [Audience] .repeat stuff.. [Audience] ..repeat stuff. [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 C\\u2019mon, louder. I can\\u2019t hear you.

I\\u2019m in magazines, full of model teens so far above you. So read them and hate your self. And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: \\u201cI love you\\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .rep\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026I am a vessel\\u2026 \\u2026.666\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026Illuminati\\u2026 We know it\\u2019s not right. We know it\\u2019s not funny. But we\\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\\u2026 Um\\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\\u2019s the end of \\u201cwhat.\\u201d I hope you liked it\\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know. [Guy voice] Young people want jokes [Guy voice] they can relate to. OK? [Guy voice] So\\u2026 Write a\\u2026 [Guy voice] Write a silly song about Facebook [Guy voice] you know, write some jokes [Guy voice] about Twitter, [Guy voice] or sugary cereal, [Guy voice] or razor scooters. [Guy voice] Relate to them. [Guy voice] You know, also [Guy voice] you gotta reestablish your presence [Guy voice] on the internet buddy. Alright?

Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019ve had our money\\u2019s worth just seeing you.\\u201d What? You\\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\\u2019m not a god. I\\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\\u2026 sort of like Jesus\\u2026 in a way\\u2026 but better. Well, I\\u2019ve actually turned up. So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\\u2019t they? They\\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\\u2019ve got\\u2026 AIDS. I\\u2019m not a doctor\\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \\u201cCor, you\\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\\u201d You know? And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do. We all do.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, Labradors.\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\\u201d \\u201cJack Russells?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d -\\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah!\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\\u201d -\\u201cMiniature poodles?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d That\\u2019s your job. \\u201cRidgebacks?\\u201d \\u201cYo!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cFuck off!\\u201d -\\u201cYeah, you are.\\u201d -\\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaking babies.\\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\\u2019s different, everyone\\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \\u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\\u201d And Bob went, \\u201cI knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains.\\u201d You\\u2019ve been amazing. Good night!

              "'[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you. [cheers and applause] What a wanker not funny at all just fucking screaming  shit like dribble running down his chin.  Yawn Your email address will not be published.

brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing they\\u2019re not taking that call \\u201coh what happened really go fuck yourself\\u201d click they don\\u2019t care  i learned a long time ago i think whatever you\\u2019re into you\\u2019re into but i\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 i didn\\u2019t like going to church every week you know i just didn\\u2019t part of it was i\\u2019m lazy i don\\u2019t like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet you know we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it \\u2013 right \\u2013  and the other aspect was you know i actually\\u2013 i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid  i did look i\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments don\\u2019t kill anybody don\\u2019t touch my wife that\\u2019s my bike right that all makes sense of which i\\u2019ve broken i think i\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one that\\u2019s it i haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and they\\u2019re wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh\\u2026 shh\\u2026 shh\\u2026 right see the whole thing so we\\u2019ll see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where we\\u2019re going and what happens after we die everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles there\\u2019s a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like \\u201cthat is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life\\u201d  yeah like your guy\\u2019s name is ron ron and he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like   years ago he had a driver\\u2019s license social security number there\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe \\u201cmotherfucker\\u201d right i know what happened he was working at denny\\u2019s he got sick of it \\u201ci\\u2019ll start a religion hey everybody there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers this is tom cruise we\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear right\\u201d look i\\u2019m paraphrasing i\\u2019m paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so\\u2026 yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we\\u2013 right we got the space shuttle you know there\\u2019s sneakers there\\u2019s a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right \\u201cah son there is no fat fuck it\\u2019s your mother and i your mom\\u2019s the tooth fairy rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true\\u201d right and i was just like \\u201cwow this is how the world is\\u201d and meanwhile this shit was just floating this  gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person \\u201cthat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other christians and\\u2026\\u201d become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just \\u201cyeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i don\\u2019t go anymore\\u201d or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think he\\u2019s along for the ride the two of them they\\u2019re a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 that rock just keeps going this dude just stops that\\u2019s what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it \\u201cand on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures\\u2026\\u201d i just floated away  so now it\\u2019s like i\\u2019m in this weird place where i\\u2019m not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  i\\u2019d like to believe in something so i\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is and i haven\\u2019t been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there they\\u2019re like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it dead like a pigeon just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there over blew my mind i\\u2019m like \\u201creally you\\u2019re just dead\\u201d like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life \\u201cwell i don\\u2019t know about this right here mind explaining yourself\\u201d this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that i\\u2019m gonna get judged someday like if that\\u2019s true that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense it\\u2019s like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didn\\u2019t run i wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever \\u201cyou evil piece of shit\\u201d just light it on fire i wouldn\\u2019t i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged \\u201canything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you i\\u2019m gonna try and help you out\\u201d yes my religion it\\u2019s nuts it\\u2019s fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t or some of your friends doesn\\u2019t even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up \\u201cjesus christ where the hell are they it\\u2019s been like  years they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right\\u201d and then one day it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it and then what i\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over \\u201chey how is it going everybody isn\\u2019t this great isn\\u2019t this great\\u201d \\u201cyeah dude it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didn\\u2019t ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals \\u2018hey hey how is it going over here\\u2019 why did you come over here i don\\u2019t give a damn dude tell your dad i don\\u2019t give a fuck i\\u2019m already in here i\\u2019m already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the boss\\u2019s son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement\\u201d so yeah so they believe when you die you\\u2019re dead and i was like so you\\u2019re just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldn\\u2019t get my head around it he goes \\u201cwell like before when you were born do you remember that\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like \\u201cyeah it\\u2019s just like that\\u201d i\\u2019m like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared i\\u2019m getting as i get older i\\u2019m developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it it\\u2019s not straightacrosstheboard flying i don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden i just don\\u2019t like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots \\u2018cause you know what i don\\u2019t think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like \\u201call right we\\u2019ll give you like  people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another  back we\\u2019ll let you do this for a while you do this for a while we don\\u2019t get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit we\\u2019ll move you up to  people and then one day you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d whoo we\\u2019re going a little faster right big

happen he\\u2019s so goddamn bored that\\u2019s a stud up there right so one time i\\u2019m flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so i\\u2019m on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like\\u2026  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of like\\u2026 all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises \\u201cwhoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa\\u201d i\\u2019m

i drive down the street and i think about that hug and it\\u2019s just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head i\\u2019ll just be driving down the street just be like\\u2026 aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head there\\u2019s something about me like all my regret comes up when i\\u2019m in the shower i don\\u2019t know what it is i think \\u2019cause i\\u2019m in the shower and i have time to think and i\\u2019ll just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and i\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026  and my wife\\u2019s always just like \\u201cis everything okay in there\\u201d i\\u2019ll just be like \\u201cyeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much\\u201d \\u201cevery day\\u201d so\\u2026 yeah\\u2026 i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her \\u201chow come we never did the hugging thing how come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff\\u201d she was like \\u201ci wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay\\u201d and i was like \\u201cyou were afraid\\u201d and she goes \\u201cwell it was your father that\\u2019s what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen so in a marriage there\\u2019s compromises\\u201d yeah so she basically never hugged us \\u2019cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta \\u201ccomedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal i\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i don\\u2019t have any kids as far as i\\u2019d think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like \\u201cdon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler\\u201d so he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to \\u201cdon\\u2019t hug him it\\u2019s gonna make him gay\\u201d right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid i\\u2019ll whittle it down to like \\u201che\\u2019s not taking drama class all right he\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause i said so lady let me handle this\\u201d i won\\u2019t fix everything and that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either that i wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isn\\u2019t i would send\\u2026 i\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless i\\u2019m sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybody\\u2019s like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but there\\u2019s no way i\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals he\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him he\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like \\u201cthere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here\\u201d i don\\u2019t want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific \\u201cyou ever do that again i\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog\\u201d all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married that\\u2019s the big thing yes i did very happy about that i\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird it\\u2019s like  years old \\u201cmy girlfriend yeah we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop\\u201d going to parties it was just weird \\u2018cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like \\u201cthe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cit\\u2019s an advanced learning program the deadline is may  we have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate\\u201d when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old i\\u2019d just be like \\u201cdid anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didn\\u2019t know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands\\u201d so now i\\u2019m married so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but i\\u2019m

thing you know why it is it\\u2019s \\u2019cause i live in los angeles yeah and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning there\\u2019s not even zoning laws they\\u2019ll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then there\\u2019s like a fucking daycare center right the city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta you\\u2019re all right i don\\u2019t know maybe in atlanta might be crazy you\\u2019re on the outskirts you\\u2019re fine you\\u2019re fine you don\\u2019t live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath you\\u2019re cool drink that water for a good  days la there\\u2019s nowhere to go that\\u2019s why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this i\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street \\u201cfuck this this looks safe\\u201d you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter she\\u2019s just like \\u201cyeah no\\u201d which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like \\u201coh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so\\u2026 there goes that hey what other dreams aren\\u2019t i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask\\u201d yeah i\\u2019m still gonna do it i\\u2019m just not gonna tell her i\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license i\\u2019m not going to tell her i\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room she\\u2019s just gonna be like \\u201cwhat is that what is that for what does that mean\\u201d \\u201cyeah someday you\\u2019ll see someday you\\u2019ll see when the shit hits the fan and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out and i\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter\\u201d \\u201cwhat is that\\u201d \\u201cshut the fuck up and get in\\u201d now you guys think i\\u2019m bullshitting i\\u2019m not i\\u2019m serious i\\u2019m  in on this and ever since i got into it i\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit \\u201cthey\\u2019re after me swear to god\\u201d i\\u2019m seeing stories about them it\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote \\u201ci never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden they\\u2019re all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away\\u201d it\\u2019s the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for  years\\u2013  years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream \\u201ci built it up for  years here you go son make the family and the family name proud\\u201d \\u201call right dad i love you\\u201d all right this poor kid five days in he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but he\\u2019s like \\u201ci need the money i gotta give him a tour\\u201d right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake \\u201cwe love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line\\u201d five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter \\u201call right if you look out the left side of the aircraft that\\u2019s orange county there\\u2019s over  miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on  miles of beaches was established as a county in  sir please don\\u2019t open the door sir what are you doing sir no no don\\u2019t don\\u2019t stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck\\u201d air traffic control \\u201ci don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201csomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter\\u201d five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was  years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man \\u201ctake me up in a chopper i\\u2019m looking at the land i love and then i\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero\\u201d i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like \\u201cfuck you disease i decide\\u201d ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer \\u201ctake me up in the chopper\\u201d he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard he\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour right \\u201cover  miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in  sir please don\\u2019t try to open the door no no don\\u2019t don\\u2019t don\\u2019t\\u201d   incredible but here\\u2019s the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean  feet up you\\u2019d think that would be enough so i\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just\\u2026 but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic  belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down he\\u2019s got to be thinking \\u201cthree more seconds of pain two more seconds\\u201d wham  \\u201coh my god this is worse this is way worse\\u201d it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital that\\u2019s right so here\\u2019s to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from

penetration right \\u2018cause they can\\u2019t show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other  of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality that\\u2019s never brought up that whole \\u201chold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to\\u201d that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like\\u2026 and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didn\\u2019t know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like \\u201cwhat are you doing\\u201d she says like \\u201ci don\\u2019t know i just kinda like ya know it\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why don\\u2019t you want to do

finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife i\\u2019m like \\u201cthat is fucking bullshit bullshit\\u201d what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try

convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old head so here we go \\u201conce upon a time there was a frog name andy\\u201d  \\u201candy lived at the patent park pond\\u201d \\u201cand he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life\\u201d \\u201che had three best friends\\u201d \\u201cmilly who never left her lily pad\\u201d  \\u201cbilly who was always hopping mad\\u201d \\u201cand roger who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn\\u201d  \\u201cso one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cone day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201candy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con

gorgeous said milly\\u201d \\u201cshe\\u2019s beautiful said billy\\u201d \\u201ca bit old for my taste said roger\\u201d \\u201cclassic roger\\u201d \\u201cand then she was gone\\u201d \\u201ci need to go find her said andy\\u201d \\u201ci need to follow my little frog heart\\u201d \\u201cso andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest\\u201d \\u201che then came across a turtle\\u201d \\u201cyou can\\u2019t pass said the turtle\\u201d \\u201cplease said andy\\u201d \\u201cno said the turtle\\u201d and this is the first long convoluted simile \\u201cthen there was a rustling in the bushes\\u201d \\u201cand like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle\\u201d    \\u201candy kept moving but at this point\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin\\u201d \\u201candy kept moving\\u201d  \\u201che then came across a giant crocodile\\u201d \\u201cand the crocodile began to chant\\u201d \\u201ci woke up this morning\\u201d \\u201cand i sat on a log\\u201d \\u201ci opened up the menu\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said frog\\u201d  \\u201candy

no god is there\\u201d \\u201cfuck\\u201d \\u201cfuck\\u201d the end the end so that\\u2019s the end of that story    if you are curious the moral of that story is irrelevant cos we are humans why would it apply to us um\\u2026 you know my father is so hard to get along with cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man you know he believes like for example you should always fight fire with fire which is a horrible way to live your life especially for him because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 he was fired\\u2026 that was as stupid as we get but let\\u2019s get a little stupider ha \\u201cthere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line\\u201d \\u201che\\u2019s trying to catch a kid\\u201d you know that stuff\\u2026 trying to get a little more mainstream  um\\u2026 people complain about the way i act on stage very often you know they say like i repeat jokes or they also say that they say\\u2026 they don\\u2019t get again that this is an act on stage they think on stage i act too arrogant too selfobsessed solipsistic selfcontained synonyms and they want me to be\\u2026 they want me to be a comic of the people you know relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy so i want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys i\\u2019m like you guys you know once a week i like to slip into a deep existential depression where i loose all my sense of oneness and self worth haha and what i like to do in order to assure my self that i am unique and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in jesus and satan\\u2019s backgammon game is i will\\u2026 i\\u2019ll say a group a words that i think no one has ever said in that order so that\\u2026 when i say it i feel like \\u201clook at me\\u201d participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of so i\\u2019ll say something random like like \\u201cpeanutbutter tribadism\\u201d or \\u201ci\\u2019m your father and i loved your comedy show\\u201d or \\u201cat first i wasn\\u2019t comfortable

booth and i don\\u2019t want to kill my self\\u201d or\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 too real or \\u201cyo man life\\u2019s about three things man\\u201d \\u201cthree things\\u201d

just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before it\\u2019s in la we fly out i\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick \\u201ci got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson i\\u2019ll introduce him yes\\u201d about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said \\u201ci got a good intro\\u201d she

welcome melissa mccarthy\\u201d i didn\\u2019t do it i would never\\u2026 i\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that it\\u2019s horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane i\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that so don\\u2019t\\u2026 even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said \\u201ci\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke\\u201d she went \\u201cwhat\\u201d i said \\u201cwhat did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas\\u201d jane went \\u201ci don\\u2019t know\\u201d i said \\u201ccancer\\u201d i didn\\u2019t do it so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist so\\u2026 i\\u2019d never say that in public so\\u2026 to anyone who mattered anyway so don\\u2019t\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going \\u201cit was transphobic\\u201d it wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and that\\u2019s the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target they\\u2019re not necessarily the same i\\u2019ll tell you the joke you make your minds up it\\u2019s live so they go \\u201cyour host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais\\u201d they\\u2019re all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously it\\u2019s brilliant right so i just go \\u201crelax i\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight i\\u2019ve changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously\\u201d and i go\\u00a0\\u201cnow caitlyn jenner of course\\u201d and what a year she\\u2019s had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d that\\u2019s a clever joke i\\u2019ll tell you why right it\\u2019s layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes i\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if she\\u2019s a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car let\\u2019s not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress that\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke just so we\\u2019re clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and\\u2026 one of the press said \\u201cwhat do you think of the ricky gervais joke\\u201d she went \\u201cmaybe i should host the golden globes\\u201d and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously\\u2026 i just sent back \\u201clet her host just don\\u2019t let her drive\\u201d another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was \\u201ccaitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais\\u201d i just sent back \\u201cat last she always brakes too late\\u201d bring it on bring it on but i\\u2019m a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying \\u201cwhy is it transphobic\\u201d they said \\u201cit\\u2019s about a trans person\\u201d that\\u2019s ridiculous that\\u2019s like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but i\\u2019m willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her i\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete\\u00a0he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man with a huge\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know i\\u2019m guessing probably he was big but i\\u2019ve learnt my lesson now i know it\\u2019s wrong i\\u2019d never deadname her now but years ago when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 years ago i\\u2019m saying and she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door the doctor went \\u201ccome in\\u201d this is years ago i\\u2019d never deadname her now but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 you know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so like \\u201ccome in\\u201d and he went \\u201chello bruce jenner\\u201d because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then the doctor\\u2013 this was years ago\\u2026 the doctor went \\u201call right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy\\u201d and bruce jenner\\u2013 that was\\u00a0his name this is years ago right so\\u2026 bruce jenner went \\u201cyeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah\\u201d \\u201cwhat can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy\\u201d and bruce jenner went\\u2013 that was his name bruce jenner went\\u2026 \\u201clook at that\\u201d the doctor went \\u201ccome on bruce jenner you know the rules\\u201d he uses his whole name every time for some reason\\u2026 \\u201ccome on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate\\u201d bruce jenner went \\u201cno that\\u2019s not my pole that\\u2019s my enormous penis\\u201d \\u201cwell seeing as it\\u2019s your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside\\u201d and bruce jenner went\\u2026 that was his name for\\u2026 fiftyeight years i think he went \\u201cno they\\u2019re not my shot puts doctor they\\u2019re my enormous testicles\\u201d that\\u2019s where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went \\u201coh yeah that makes perfect\\u2013 i\\u2019m a medical man you\\u2019re a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy you\\u2019re a big\\u2026 you\\u2019re big and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls they\\u2019re beautiful\\u201d bit familiar innit \\u201cno you must be very proud of them bruce\\u201d bruce went \\u201cthis is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them\\u201d and the doctor went \\u201cwhat why\\u201d \\u201coh they get in the way\\u201d \\u201cin the way of what\\u201d \\u201cfucking driving for one thing\\u201d so i\\u2019m engaging these people and i\\u2019m saying \\u201cbut i had to say her old name that\\u2019s the joke i say \\u201ci\\u2019ve changed not as much as bruce jenner\\u201d then i do the joke\\u201d but no this is my second crime i say she hasn\\u2019t changed she\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman that means she\\u2019s a woman fine if that\\u2019s the rules if you feel you\\u2019re a woman you are i\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough cause i\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say i\\u2019m a chimp i am a chimp preop but\\u2026 don\\u2019t ever deadname me don\\u2019t call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo i\\u2019m gonna have species realignment i\\u2019m halfway there i\\u2019m short with short legs and long arms i stoop my back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day i\\u2019ve got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like\\u2026 so\\u2026 i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say i\\u2019m a chimp i\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy that\\u2019d be lovely i\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so\\u2026 you know i reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp we\\u2019re so close than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out into\\u2013 i\\u2019m not a doctor but that is\\u2026 the gist of it i know which one i\\u2019d rather have done i\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i can\\u2019t see you but to me every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp so\\u2026 so i\\u2019d have all that done hair and that i\\u2019d do all that all the\\u2026 i\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies i\\u2019m talking to jane she\\u2019s going \\u201cwhat is it\\u201d \\u201cwhat is it bobo\\u201d \\u201cyou left the fucking oven on there\\u2019s a fire\\u201d are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert she\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 easy so i\\u2019d have all that done top lip doing all that right i\\u2019ll be legally a chimp i\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimpedup i\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets i\\u2019ll be walking along holding jane\\u2019s hand \\u201ccome on bobo\\u201d right we don\\u2019t hold hands now i don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now i\\u2019m a chimp but we\\u2019ll be all in love maybe matching jumpers \\u201ccome on bobo\\u201d in love just two\\u2026 like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes \\u201cthat\\u2019s fucking disgusting\\u201d i\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree and that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic so\\u2026 cheers so humanity what is humanity what are we well we\\u2019ve touched upon it there we\\u2019re great apes not metaphorically we\\u2019re literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee we\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die now\\u2026 my sevenyearold niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that but i said \\u201cyou\\u2019ve gotta learn stop crying\\u201d i said \\u201cyou\\u2019re seven you know\\u2026 today so\\u2026 any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled so\\u2026\\u201d let\\u2019s take the first of those birth it\\u2019s odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early that\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes \\u201ci\\u2019m proper pregnant\\u201d right i\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes \\u201cmum\\u201d it\\u2019s got to be fucking ready we\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless right just think nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment everything\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass you\\u2019re covered in shit there\\u2019s screaming you go \\u201ci can\\u2019t breathe\\u201d someone goes \\u201cyes you fucking can\\u201d the first one second of life\\u00a0on earth you don\\u2019t know where you are you can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born i was\\u00a0born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that i\\u2019d have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took\\u00a0 years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous it\\u2019s a rarefied place it\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i don\\u2019t know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested there weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god there\\u2019s no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasn\\u2019t always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying \\u201che\\u2019s out of touch he\\u2019s so famous he\\u2019s rich he\\u2019s megarich\\u201d i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like \\u201che\\u2019s an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum\\u201d and i say i say \\u201cdon\\u2019t call them scum right\\u201d but even the papers they try and\\u2026 get around to it i do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say \\u201cdo you always fly first class\\u201d i go \\u201cno often private\\u201d right the number of times i\\u2019ve answered this question they say \\u201cdo you know how much a pint of milk is\\u201d to make you look out of touch i don\\u2019t know but that\\u2019s irrelevant next time a journalist asks me i\\u2019ll say \\u201ci don\\u2019t know but here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand run and get me one\\u201d is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece they\\u2019re still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have children\\u201d i say \\u201cno\\u201d \\u201cwhy don\\u2019t you have children\\u201d which is an odd question why don\\u2019t you have children as opposed to asking people \\u201cwhy do you have children\\u201d let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette that one just\\u2026 go and claim for that people say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level there\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going \\u201cwe want to be born\\u201d right but i\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons i don\\u2019t have children three main reasons and i\\u2019ll share them with you three reasons one there\\u2019s millions the world\\u2019s overpopulated noone\\u2019s going \\u201crick\\u2019s not having kids we\\u2019re gonna run out fuck\\u201d two kids are scroungers aren\\u2019t they i mean from day one it\\u2019s all \\u201cme me me\\u201d isn\\u2019t it \\u201cfeed me\\u201d \\u201cclothe me\\u201d \\u201cpay for my chemotherapy\\u201d no\\u2026 no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they don\\u2019t want to pay you back they\\u2019re not grateful they don\\u2019t go \\u201cthanks for having me\\u201d it\\u2019s \\u201ci didn\\u2019t wanna be born\\u201d even if they get a top job which they won\\u2019t you\\u2019ll never see that money back they\\u2019ll just put you in a home okay and my kid he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth wouldn\\u2019t he so\\u2026 he\\u2019d be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty \\u201ci\\u2019m a little hampstead cunt\\u201d yes i know \\u201cthese are my

money until i was  i\\u2019ve got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesn\\u2019t take much i\\u2019l give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time you\\u2019re horrified \\u201ceveryone\\u2019s looking\\u201d pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went \\u201cwhere\\u2019s that bloke i\\u2019m not queueing\\u201d it\\u2019s quick when i fly to the states i\\u2019ve got a place there but i\\u2019m always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesn\\u2019t get any better even if i was paying i\\u2019d still go first class but jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 it\\u2019s ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movie\\u2019s on she\\u2019ll love that she\\u2019ll be up for that but when someone else is paying i say \\u201cjane get up here with me\\u201d right front two seats\\u2026 they board us early we\\u2019re on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne it\\u2019s great it\\u2019s like a day off no phone or anything it\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday flying to the states\\ni could do without the safety video that\\u2019s always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked you\\u2019re going down the plane smashes you go \\u201ci\\u2019ll try it\\u201d you do that ball of flames you wake up everyone\\u2019s dead you go \\u201cfucking hell that\\u2019s amazing that is\\u201d and they always use that voice don\\u2019t they that calming hypnotic voice like \\u201cnothing bad will happen\\u201d they\\u2019re saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because i\\u2019m using this voice don\\u2019t worry things like \\u201cin the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d it smashes the fuck to bits right they say \\u201cin the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle\\u201d a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyone\\u2019s dead except you by a miracle you\\u2019re bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is you\\u2019ve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark or you drown you\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent airsea rescue you\\u2019re going \\u201cgod i\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die i don\\u2019t know what i\\u2019m doing\\u201d hold on i mean air sea rescue\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter o course you haven\\u2019t but\\u2026 they\\u2019re fucking loud it\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle it\\u2019s like\\u2026 like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that it\\u2019s brilliant right\\u2026 i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round \\u201cchampagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais\\u201d she goes off i go \\u201chave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts\\u201d she went \\u201cwe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight a lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction\\u201d i went \\u201coh my god of course\\u201d i was fuming i mean\\u2026 what\\u2019s that got to do with me why can\\u2019t i eat nuts just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 how has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly it\\u2019s\\u2026 and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean\\u2026 i never wanted nuts more i felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought \\u201coh i wish i\\u2019d brought my own nuts on\\u201d right i thought for a second but that wouldn\\u2019t work she\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that\\u2026 and\\u2026 die and someone would go \\u201cricky gervais brought his own nuts on\\u201d you know right so i don\\u2019t take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case then i go \\u201ccan i have any nuts\\u201d they go \\u201cno sorry this lady would die\\u201d \\u201cyeah not a problem\\u201d lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 i go

ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause i\\u2019m this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cyou should never make jokes about food allergies\\u201d i should have left it right i sent back \\u201ci make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and you\\u2019re telling me i should never joke about food allergies\\u201d she sent back \\u201cyes\\u00a0but the holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children\\u201d well\\u2026 it

of them children i have to say hitler you couldn\\u2019t make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy\\u2026 evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible

with their emotions they want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do it\\u2019s why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think i\\u2019ve lived through the best  years of humanity\\u2026  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe i\\u2019m not saying this because i\\u2019m old old people say things like \\u201coh everything was better when i was a kid\\u201d course it was you were a kid everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid being old is the shit bit whatever\\u2019s happening being old is\\u2026 i wake up these days and i go \\u201coh fuck i didn\\u2019t die\\u201d gotta do it all again i\\u2019m usually hung over headache liver pains i can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes \\u2019cause i\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees i\\u2019m getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about \\u00a0proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years\\u2026 and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor\\u2026 and\\u2026 i was saying to jane \\u201ci\\u2019m having a heart attack\\u201d right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because i\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole and then it\\u2019s just fucked it\\u2019s like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week it\\u2019s like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack but it worried jane she said \\u201cyou gotta look after yourself\\u201d i thought \\u201cyou\\u2019re right \\u201d so i started working out right every day i didn\\u2019t give anything up i don\\u2019t eat meat anymore but i was having   calories\\u00a0a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training\\u2026 i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories i can\\u2019t do enough cause i\\u2019m so old and broken and tired so i\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die i\\u2019m losing my hair it\\u2019s getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but\\u2026 no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right i\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon i\\u2019d never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party it\\u2019ll go \\u201cthere\\u2019s a wig in here\\u201d i go \\u201cis there\\u201d \\u201cyes there is yeah\\u201d spidey senses for the wig it\\u2019s obvious the way they smile like nothing\\u2019s wrong hiya it\\u2019s the telltale signs isn\\u2019t it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke he\\u2019s dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201celvis what is\\u2013\\u201d i was about eight i said to auntie edna \\u201cwhat happened\\u201d she went \\u201cit was a miracle\\u201d they were lying they were just\\u2026 everyone knew he was bald but he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well they\\u2019re going \\u201cyeah it just grew back\\u201d there\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said \\u201creg is allergic to balloons\\u201d he wasn\\u2019t allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room we\\u2019ve got photos in the family album if he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening and he\\u2019s holding a baby it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length like that so it can\\u2019t grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 how\\u2019s the chemo going uncle \\u201cnot a problem\\u201d we\\u2019ve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it he\\u2019s wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket you\\u2019re ready because you\\u2019re warned you know about getting old what they don\\u2019t talk about so you\\u2019re not prepared and it was a shock to me\\u2026 i only found out recently i\\u2019ll share it with you now the distending testicles see you don\\u2019t know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 i didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for  years as a young man they were pert and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock i don\\u2019t know when it happened but it was recently they just\\u2026 and this is how i found out so as i\\u2019ve been getting older and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as i\\u2019ve got older i\\u2019ve got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and they\\u2019re floating right now i\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like they\\u2019d be heavy you could tie things down with them and they\\u2019d sink you know most people never see their\\u2026 in the sea you\\u2019re in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep that was my first thought \\u201coh my god i never thought testicles would float\\u201d then my second thought kicked in \\u201chold on this bath\\u2019s two feet deep\\u201d right i\\u2019m sitting on the bottom they\\u2019re on top what\\u2019s going on right and\\u2026 i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact they\\u2019d created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just\\u2026 floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle i\\u2019m just thinking \\u201cthis is bizarre\\u201d fucking hell right and\\u2026 i thought \\u201cmaybe it\\u2019s a fluke\\u201d so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up they\\u2019re really\\u2026 they\\u2019re really buoyant right try it when you get home if you\\u2019re in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but\\u2026 but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d \\u201cagree with me\\u201d it falls into two tribes \\u201ci don\\u2019t agree with them so i block them\\u201d and now in this posttruth era people don\\u2019t care about the argument they say \\u201cwho\\u2019s saying the argument no they\\u2019re not on our side\\u201d it\\u2019s ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying \\u201ci believe the earth is  years old\\u201d \\u201ci believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot\\u201d you can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake and there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of \\u201clet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think\\u201d let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cdo not drink\\u201d right let\\u2019s take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but it\\u2019s not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like \\u201ctweet us your news\\u201d don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news \\u201ci saw a tyrannosaurus rex\\u201d you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said \\u201cwe\\u2019ve looked at everything and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldn\\u2019t happen again\\u201d that would have been it but the guy went \\u201cwe asked the public what they thought\\u201d then there was three banal vox pops first one said \\u201ci already pay \\u00a3 a year so i\\u2019m not happy\\u201d the next one said \\u201cit takes me  minutes each way it\\u2019s not good enough\\u201d the last one said \\u201ci say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead\\u201d why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted you\\u2019re in early ted oh ted we\\u2019ve been through this remember i said i\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead but\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say \\u201cit\\u2019s fine to be an atheist it\\u2019s fine to believe in god and it\\u2019s fine not to\\u201d that\\u2019s all i was saying i realized i didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people i\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201chappy birthday earth four point six billion years old today\\u201d someone would always go \\u201cwe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing\\u201d this is a tweet i got\\u00a0after one of those and\\u2026 it was all in capitals which excited me\\u2026 that\\u2019s the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger it\\u2019s great right i looked at his profile sure

he\\u2019s fighting back really witlessly saying things like \\u201cgo fuck your sister you english faggot\\u201d that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again it\\u2019s still all going off right it\\u2019s really funny i\\u2019m laughing at all the replies people saying things to him i\\u2019m scrolling down there\\u2019s one tweet directly to me from this woman she says \\u201cyou find rape funny\\u201d no no what no\\u2026 \\u201cyour mates find rape funny\\u201d no listen right \\u201cyou find rape funny\\u201d listen everyone listen right no\\u2026 i said to her \\u201ci didn\\u2019t tweet that\\u201d she went \\u201cyou retweeted it\\u201d to show he\\u2019s an idiot \\u201cbut you must find it funny or amusing it\\u2019s not a frivolous thing\\u201d i said \\u201cno well it\\u2019s up to him isn\\u2019t it he can do it\\u201d now i\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but i\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because i\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didn\\u2019t say \\u201cwhat you find jokes about rape funny\\u201d she said \\u201cwhat you find rape funny\\u201d the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying \\u201cit was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling\\u201d that\\u2019s never\\u2026 so\\u2026 i sent back \\u201cyou mean jokes about rape\\u201d she said \\u201cyes\\u201d i went \\u201cdepends on the joke\\u201d \\u201cit fucking doesn\\u2019t\\u201d i\\u2019m going \\u201cno it does it does it depends on the joke it\\u2019s about context\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content what do you mean by a rape joke\\u201d she said \\u201ceven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable\\u201d i said \\u201cthat\\u2019s ridiculous it depends what the joke is\\u201d i tweeted that clip of me in the office going \\u201ci think there\\u2019s been a rape up there\\u201d everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man who\\u2019s so narcissistic he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said\\u00a0\\u201csome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down they don\\u2019t punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play\\u00a0on words that don\\u2019t really mean anything\\u201d a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it i\\u2019ll tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says \\u201chelp i\\u2019ve been graped\\u201d the policeman says \\u201cdo you mean raped\\u201d she says \\u201cno there was a bunch of them\\u201d that is a rape joke right so\\u2026 and i even said to her \\u201cno i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting i\\u2019d never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject\\u201d i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying \\u201cwell okay i see your point but\\u2026 still\\u2026 i will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it when noone in the audience has been raped\\u201d i should have left it i just sent back \\u201cwhat a weird door policy\\u201d you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says \\u201ccan i just ask you a question\\u201d yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you can\\u2019t come in what why a lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in off you go that\\u2019s what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter i\\u2019m not tweeting anyone i\\u2019m just tweeting i don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me i\\u2019ve got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally that\\u2019s like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cguitar lessons\\u201d and you go \\u201cbut i don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons\\u201d what\\u2019s this there\\u2019s a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i don\\u2019t fucking want any fine it\\u2019s not for you then just walk away don\\u2019t worry about it\\ni should say one thing in twitter\\u2019s defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally i\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tesco\\u2019s or something that\\u2019s the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament i\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through twitter when we\\u2019ve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard i\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say \\u201cban bullfighting\\u201d someone always says \\u201cwhat about the kids in syria\\u201d what well i\\u2019m not giving you a choice you can do both i\\u2019m not saying \\u201cthrow that kid back in the hole there\\u2019s a bull here\\u201d and there\\u2019s one thing that i didn\\u2019t want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter there\\u2019s a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and it\\u2019s horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back it\\u2019s a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people don\\u2019t really read it it\\u2019s a kneejerk people say \\u201cracist\\u201d i go \\u201cwhat\\u201d they go \\u201cwe eat pigs and cows in the west\\u201d yep we do i don\\u2019t but yeah i used to you\\u2019re right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog it\\u2019s not about the species it\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first \\u2018cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture\\u2026 on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive it\\u2019s screaming they\\u2019re laughing it\\u2019s the worst thing i\\u2019ve ever seen i thought \\u201ci\\u2019ve got to tweet that\\u201d i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said \\u201cone beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive\\u201d right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said \\u201cis that language necessary\\u201d i should have left it right but i was\\u2026 i was incensed i said \\u201cyou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death\\u201d she said \\u201ci just hate the cword\\u201d i definitely should have left it i sent back \\u201cpeople who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts\\u201d thank you you\\u2019ve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do that\\u2019s not the point i\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think it\\u2019s my upbringing i grew up\\u2026 in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized \\u201che\\u2019s healing them\\u201d that\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for what humor\\u2019s for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and he\\u2019d get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought he\\u2019d won the argument and he\\u2019d tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought \\u201cif it looked\\u00a0respectable we\\u2019d be respectable\\u201d it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read \\u201cis that pedophile postman still reading your mail\\u201d and she\\u2019d take it she\\u2019d go in and she\\u2019d be horrified she\\u2019d call bob \\u201che saw it this time you must stop doing that\\u201d even at her funeral\\u2026 my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mum\\u2019s funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right we\\u2019d never been to church he didn\\u2019t know us we didn\\u2019t know him so he said to bob \\u201ctell me about your mum so i can say a few words\\u201d bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said \\u201cwell she was a keen racist\\u201d the vicar went \\u201ci can\\u2019t say that\\u201d bob said \\u201cokay put she liked gardening\\u201d he was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didn\\u2019t warn us and he did get something by the vicar so we\\u2019re called ricky robert\\u2013 bob\\u2013 ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out he\\u2019s a standup guy larry so bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name didn\\u2019t warn us we\\u2019re all in church start of the funeral we\\u2019re all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes\\u2026 eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and\\u2026 we snort like that right bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 everyone realizes we\\u2019re all laughing we see larry go\\u2026 all right and the church is like\\u2026 every time we thought of it we\\u2019d see larry go\\u2026 like that right then we\\u2019d just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicar\\u2019s thinking \\u201cwhat have i said\\u201d right he\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying i\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues they\\u2019d take one and hand it on before the funeral i\\u2019d taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said \\u201csnivelling fucking bitch\\u201d and they\\u2019re sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said \\u201csorry was that okay\\u201d me and bob went\\u00a0\\u201cfucking brilliant\\u00a0mate it was fucking brilliant\\u201d that\\u2019s what i mean we\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity you\\u2019re bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny you\\u2019ve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well\\u2026 it might go badly but you\\u2019ve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right\\u2026 so\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day bob\\u2019s driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and there\\u2019s a british bobby there and he stops the car bob\\u2019s at the window he said \\u201cwhere are we off to\\u201d bob went \\u201cbognor\\u201d he went\\u00a0\\u201ccan you just pop the boot please\\u201d so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bob\\u2019s window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes and the copper went \\u201cbet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets\\u201d and bob went \\u201ci knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains\\u201d you\\u2019ve been

city they got a wall around their own city theyre brushing off cases of pedophilia like its nothing theyre not taking that call oh what happened really go fuck yourself click they dont care  i learned a long time ago i think whatever youre into youre into but im not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didnt like to go\\u2013 i didnt like going to church every week you know i just didnt part of it was im lazy i dont like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasnt come back yet you know were just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it \\u2013 right \\u2013  and the other aspect was you know i actually\\u2013 i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody elses sounded stupid  i did look im not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments dont kill anybody dont touch my wife thats my bike right that all makes sense of which ive broken i think ive broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one thats it i havent killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and theyre wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh shh shh right see the whole thing so well see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where were going and what happens after we die everybody elses religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles theres a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life  yeah like your guys name is ron ron and he wasnt alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like   years ago he had a drivers license social security number theres like footage of him stubbing his toe motherfucker right i know what happened he was working at dennys he got sick of it ill start a religion hey everybody theres this spaceship coming back everybodys getting sneakers this is tom cruise were gonna try to make you clear right look im paraphrasing im paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but thats essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesnt you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we\\u2013 right we got the space shuttle you know theres sneakers theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right ah son there is no fat fuck its your mother and i your moms the tooth fairy rabbits dont have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams wont come true right and i was just like wow this is how the world is and meanwhile this shit was just floating this  gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i dont go anymore or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think hes along for the ride the two of them theyre a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going this dude just stops thats what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didnt read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated away  so now its like im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  id like to believe in something so ive been going around asking people what their shit is and i havent been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there theyre like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die youre dead and thats it dead like a pigeon just\\u2013 just layin there over blew my mind im like really youre just dead like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life well i dont know about this right here mind explaining yourself this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that im gonna get judged someday like if thats true that somebodys gonna judge me that doesnt even make any sense its like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right lets not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you dont think this things gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didnt run i wouldnt burn it forever you evil piece of shit just light it on fire i wouldnt i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you im gonna try and help you out yes my religion its nuts its fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldnt or some of your friends doesnt even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if thats the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up jesus christ where the hell are they its been like  years they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right and then one day it just settles in that they didnt make it and then what im still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over hey how is it going everybody isnt this great isnt this great yeah dude itd be even better if all my family members and friends werent burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didnt ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals hey hey how is it going over here why did you come over here i dont give a damn dude tell your dad i dont give a fuck im already in here im already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the bosss son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement so yeah so they believe when you die youre dead and i was like so youre just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldnt get my head around it he goes well like before when you were born do you remember that and i was like no and the guys like yeah its just like that im like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared im getting as i get older im developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it its not straightacrosstheboard flying i dont like small planes all of a sudden i just dont like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just dont believe in the pilots cause you know what i dont think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like all right well give you like  people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another  back well let you do this for a while you do this for a while we dont get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit well move you up to  people and then one day youll be in a jet\\u2013 whoo were going a little faster right big planes youre getting the fuckin pilot that knows what hes doing hes probably fought in a war hes used to getting shot at he cant bring this bus in its a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back my headphones dont work he doesnt give a fuck right hes up there sleeping hes trying to make something happen hes so goddamn bored thats a stud up there right so one time im flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so im on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the planes made of like all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa im not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a  mustachioed male going whoo whaaa whoa dude the hair was standing up on my arms im praying to a higher power i dont even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit jesus christ you know you think im not up here thinking whaaa whoa i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we do  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now its all car stuff looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didnt fit what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit dads gonna be mad  theres never enough time to build the car its so fucking stupid we got to have this bus done by thursday or else what the guy doesnt want it anymore all right youll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch so before  before there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it theyre like all right stay away from that one stay away from that one hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love well hes nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that youre rolling the dice youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and youre gonna turn around all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i dont know man thats risky you know in reality im being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am cause i was just as scared as he was except i didnt scream out like he did and thats simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going how was your day whats wrong and all of that shit you know thats why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that youre a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock em down right come on it didnt hurt get up i didnt come from a family i dont know about you guys i didnt come from a touchyfeely call me when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head ill just be driving down the street just be like aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head theres something about me like all my regret comes up when im in the shower i dont know what it is i think cause im in the shower and i have time to think and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and ill just be in the shower just being like  and my wifes always just like is everything okay in there ill just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much every day so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didnt do that stuff she was like i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay and i was like you were afraid and she goes well it was your father thats what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them thats whats gonna happen so in a marriage theres compromises yeah so she basically never hugged us cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle\\u2013 sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i dont have any kids as far as id think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like dont change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler so he took it from that and knocked it down to dont hug him its gonna make him gay right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid ill whittle it down to like hes not taking drama class all right hes not taking drama class cause i said so lady let me handle this i wont fix everything and thats not a homophobic thing either that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isnt i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybodys like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here i dont want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married thats the big thing yes i did very happy about that im very happy because it was starting to get weird its like  years old my girlfriend yeah were gonna go out and get some pop going to parties it was just weird cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis its just its an advanced learning program the deadline is may  we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old id just be like did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didnt know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands so now im married so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but im  years old im just thinking its too fucking late ya know come on man im gonna have a kid im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee we used to use these on a saturday do a face plant my kids standing there mom dads sleeping again i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i dont understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit hey man its kind of cold out today dude you dont understand you dont understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right mine just turned six mine just turned seven i just feel hopelessly behind so what im actually thinking of doing im thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesnt have to be brandnew you know its like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right id love to adopt its a great thing to do but if i do it im not telling any of my friends im just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss em off mine just turned six mine just turned seven id love to just show up with an eightyearold like dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you dont understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam theyre just there like with all their issues i should do it though i should adopt i think its a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to

meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris standing next to me  kills confirmed fucking kills theyre not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you cant coach that right

just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right youre not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay so i figure uh i dont know if ill do it maybe im too selfish i have no idea im all over the fuckin map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do thats my latest thing you know why it is its cause i live in los angeles yeah and its an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning theres not even zoning laws theyll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then theres like a fucking daycare center right the city doesnt even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta youre all right i dont know maybe in atlanta might be crazy youre on the outskirts youre fine youre fine you dont live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath youre cool drink that water for a good  days la theres nowhere to go thats why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this im out vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street fuck this this looks safe you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter shes just like yeah no which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so there goes that hey what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask yeah im still gonna do it im just not gonna tell her im just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license im not going to tell her im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room shes just gonna be like what is that what is that for what does that mean yeah someday youll see someday youll see when the shit hits the fan and youre freaking the fuck out and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter what is that shut the fuck up and get in now you guys think im bullshitting im not im serious im  in on this and ever since i got into it im seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit theyre after me swear to god im seeing stories about them its just like that old advertising anecdote i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden theyre all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away its the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for  years\\u2013  years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream i built it up for  years here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad i love you all right this poor kid five days in hes supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but hes like i need the money i gotta give him a tour right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft thats orange county theres over  miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on  miles of beaches was established as a county in  sir please dont open the door sir what are you doing sir no no dont dont stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control i dont know whos on this frequency but you really need\\u2013 somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was  years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didnt go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man take me up in a chopper im looking at the land i love and then im jumping out like a superhero i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i cant imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like fuck you disease i decide ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer take me up in the chopper he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard hes not even listening to this guy giving the tour right over  miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in  sir please dont try to open the door no no dont dont dont   incredible but heres the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean  feet up youd think that would be enough so im thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic  belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didnt change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down hes got to be thinking three more seconds of pain two more seconds wham  oh my god this is worse this is way worse it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital thats right so heres to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but ive finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesnt want me to get one so yeah she didnt want\\u2013 dude you got to pick your fucking battles im gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i cant fucking have some  hanging around ill do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it cant be that person now it fucking bums me

bring the gun up point it at the car i pull the trigger i saw the muzzle flash i felt a kick i never heard the gun i pulled the trigger all i just heard was  i shot the gun four more times never heard

argument all you gun guys you got your thing loaded right your piece right right there loaded for bear youre lying there same scenario right one leg under the covers one without shirt  in the morning youre just  meanwhile some psycho sneaking in through the living room window right he brings in a fucking sickle and hes just listening listens all the way down that hall and he just hears  hes trying not to squeak on the floorboards and youre just fucking lying there  all of a sudden that little dog on the floor is just like   whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter boy

fuckin  youre like psychotic with this shit all right no no no no no no no let me\\u2013 i will extend an olive branch to you people okay i get it i get it that a  is basically a roidedup bb gun i got it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebodys head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i dont care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i dont give a fuck how tough you are i dont care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup thats a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night look im coming back im coming back ive been trying to get along with my wife better im trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship im not turning out the pilot light though all right im keeping some fight in me im not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like i guess were making holiday cookies that dude with the bowed shoulders she makes them and then im supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i dont even think they taste that good but just\\u2013 no i stand my ground sometimes sometimes i let it go you just got to figure it out we had a fight the other night she got so mad at me she was like you can just sleep downstairs you can just sleep downstairs i couldnt believe it its one of the most arrogant things ive ever heard in my life one adult telling another adult where they can sleep you can just sleep downstairs like i was just gonna sit up in bed grab a blanket like linus all right hey where downstairs by the way like over here downstairs or like more over here where should i sleep its like are you out of your mind i go im not sleeping downstairs shes like where you gonna sleep then im like where i always sleep i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to what are you gonna do im bigger than you ill hang onto the covers try to get me out no tickling go ahead yeah i was like you dont tell me where to sleep i sleep where i want to sleep shes like well you dont tell me where to sleep im like im not the one telling people where to sleep it was one of those classic relationship fights its like  in the morning youre both half naked shes not wearing a bra you got half a ball hanging out and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted its fuckin unreal but what kills me is that theres actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them theyll be hey hows it been going its been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right no i dont i dont understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if youre dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to shes gonna come at you well lets get you in an arm bar all right all right all right tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch like  minutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch i fucking hate when she does this its like its not even fair have a debate like a normal person all right im gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone whos actually been sleeping on the couch okay so theres the first fear out the window okay she cant physically dominate you so thats gone whats the next fear shes gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized its the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her join me yeah ive never understood that threat thats like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now whats the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you cant handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad shes never bodyslammed me once ever im not saying to be a dick all right im just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback hey hey hey hey hey rest of the shit\\u2013 im learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everythings cool everythings cool just yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great im having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people im talking to people i am having a good time here thats what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something heres an olive branch ive extended to her its basically we fight a lot over television ive kind of come her way shes come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i dont care the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader ill watch it right i dont mind them its an uplifting story i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out theyre just so fucking nice its like missionarystyle theres candles that stupid saxophone music  it always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right cause they cant show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other  of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality thats never brought up that whole hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i dont even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didnt even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didnt know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like what are you doing she says like i dont know i just kinda like ya know its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why dont you want to do it itll be fun why dont i want to do it i dont think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up yeah shes in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while theyll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didnt know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god its the wall oh my god its supporting me maybe hell support me its a metaphor i love it yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall im like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife im like that is fucking bullshit bullshit what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all shes gonna do is this shes got to bring it up like an offsides call if thats what shes doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these muscles  maybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than  seconds before theyre like all right this is ridiculous okay my calves are burning i cant get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world these guys in the movie they have no problem banging away then they pick them up like theyre not heavy they start walking down they see the bed they just lay her down on the bed dude im not trying to be a dick but every woman in here is heavy yeah youre heavy youre an adult female jesus christ when do you stop picking up your kids when theyre like five or six get off of me jesus christ youre gonna throw out my back go jump on your brother an adult woman weighs  pounds  all the way up to god knows what and its not balanced weight most of its in your thighs and in your ass your heads hanging off trying to counterbalance dude when guys go to the gym we dont put  pounds on one side and a  over here fuckin yeah yeah its ridiculous trying to carry a naked woman its like trying to carry a halffilled waterbed mattress youre like bumping into shit when you see the bed you dont walk to it you slowly start picking up momentum then she bounces off this mattress hits the wall slides down the whole sex vibes ruined and youre back to your sandwich in your pocket all right im out of time you guys were awesome thank you so much thank you thank you i had

like grains of sand cos they stick together often near my butthole if life is an ocean i am a deep and handsome fish a fish thats drowning if the artistic process is a birth canal then i am a freshly jellied kid come witness my crowning these thoughts of mine must be a sign that im hashtag deep if jesus can walk on water can he swim on land have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face me neither me neither have you ever wrote a song note for note and not a single note was out of place  the people in my life are like blades of grass how cos theyre all so grounded but at least grass stays away from my butthole art is a harlot and i am her sassy urban friend oooh thats why youre being so selfish if mamma is right and the world is my oyster then i must have an allergy to shell you dont know how could you know if life makes you wish you were dead just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head spend forever asleep cos life pales in comparison to living the dream hashtag deep  thank you     dont you hate it when that happens yeah thank you thats called beating off in a minor yes yes aminor the key not the felony so i believe  i believe theres nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with  other guys its true its early caveman cromagnon wandering though the fog you know scrubbing  other sapiens no homo  id like to do erm do some poems right now erm if thats ok were at this point at the show these poems are actually im releasing this special for free so im going to plug my poetry book these are my new poems from my poetry book called egghead that will be out by the time this is airing but not by the time you guys are seated here right now they are pretty serious and its all just sort of this is usually the lull of the show usually so i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience and just read some poems and then well go back to the giggles so this is a poem by a dog roses are gray violets are a different shade of gray lets go chase cars    me with my strange choice of adjectives you with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina  i put a chameleon on a red dildo well he blushed there we go  this is a poem about beauty about self image and about the ability to transform martha was ugly like a shaven baboon so she wrapped her self up in a curtain cocoon and after a week she finally emerged she smelled like shit what a psycho    youre incomparable like a        i want to beat you to death with a blunt object i want to grab one of those high end fashion manikins by the ankles and bash your rib cage in i want to sharpen  pencils bind them with a rubber band stick the lead in your mouth and punch the erasers i want to strap you to a bed of nails then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car so i can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps in a mall parking lot during an earthquake i want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and then somehow not survive a small fender bender on the way back from a hospital    thank you thats called dad    this is a poem its really a story thats meant primarily for children but i think its got a lesson we could all learn the squares lived happily in their square houses in their square yard in their square town but then one day a family of circles moved in from the west get out of here roundies shouted one of the squares why said one of the circles cos this is a metaphor for racism      when i walk into a party youd think i was one of those long straight tetris pieces cos everyones just like oh yeah this guys here finally weve been waiting for him to show up like you wait in the game forget it  no you had your chance if i had a million dollars id pay your mother to have sex with me afterwards id probably invest the remaining  ten dollars for sex with your mother comedy i smell comedy well it was comedy giving off that scent and finally mid october with leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings the streets dicing our town into neat unfair portions and me eating that pussy baby    thank you so much um theres things that i dont want to come across in my show that i worry often come across about me cos people dont realize its an act up here i dont want you to ever think that i think that im better then people or that i think i know better then people um anyway sorry ok this is a song from the perspective of god      books you think i wrote are way to thick who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldnt be a dick and i dont watch you when you sleep surprisingly i dont use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep youre not going to heaven why the fuck would you think id ever kick it with you none of you are going to heaven theres a trillion aliens cooler then you you shouldnt abstain from rape just cos you think that i want you to you shouldnt rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do pretty obvious just dont fucking rape people didnt think i needed to write that one down for you i dont think masturbation is obscene its absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing ive ever seen you make my job a living hell i send gays to fix overpopulation boy did that go well youre not going to heaven eat a thousand crackers sing a million hymns none of you are going to heaven youre not my children you are a bad game of sim you shouldnt abstain from pork just cos you think that i want you to you can eat pork cos why the fuck would i give a shit i created the universe you think im drawing the line at the fucking deli isle    you argue and you bicker and you fight atheists and catholics jews and hindus argue day and night over what they think is true but no one entertains the thought that maybe god does not believe in you you pray so badly for heaven knowing any day might be the day that you die but maybe life on earth could be heaven doesnt just the thought of it make it worth a try my loves the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it you wont need it my loves the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it you wont need it im not gonna give you love just cos i know that you want me to if you want love then the love has gotta come from you     walking between the micorphones is really awkward tell me about it um women are stupid yeah i fucking said it they are the weaker dumber sex i can prove it to you i like to practice safe sex why cos im a guy and im smarter what do women say every time every time i put on a condom what do they say why are you wearing a condom im fucking you with a strapon to be safe bitch women right theyre the dumb ones its time for a story lets do a story  its time for a story its time for a story a very special story especially for you its time for a story its time for a story sit down and listen now dont be a jew this story is called its a glitch you can be jewish this story this story is called andy the frog featuring long and convoluted similes and ill warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears its old head so here we go once upon a time there was a frog name andy  andy lived at the patent park pond and he never hopped anywhere else in his entire frog life he had three best friends milly who never left her lily pad  billy who was always hopping mad and roger who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn  so one day one day andy saw something hop across the grass on the other side of the pond milly billy roger look said andy across the pond stood the most beautiful frog andy had ever seen shes gorgeous said milly shes beautiful said billy a bit old for my taste said roger classic roger and then she was gone i need to go find her said andy i need to follow my little frog heart so andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest he then came across a turtle you cant pass said the turtle please said andy no said the turtle and this is the first long convoluted simile then there was a rustling in the bushes and like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle the turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle    andy kept moving but at this point like the doctor of the kenyan track team his patience ran thin andy kept moving  he then came across a giant crocodile and the crocodile began to chant i woke up this morning and i sat on a log i opened up the menu the menu said frog  andy said no no please let go of me i can feel my self dying youre ripping out my insides im never going to find her am i theres no god is there fuck fuck the end the end so thats the end of that story    if you are curious the moral of that story is irrelevant cos we are humans why would it apply to us um you know my father is so hard to get along with cos hes such a mans man you know he believes like for example you should always fight fire with fire which is a horrible way to live your life especially for him because hes a firefighter so he was fired that was as stupid as we get but lets get a little stupider ha theres a creepy old man fishing in a park and the only problem is he tied a candy bar to the end of his line hes trying to catch a kid you know that stuff trying to get a little more mainstream  um people complain about the way i act on stage very often you know they say like i repeat jokes or they also say that they say they dont get again that this is an act on stage they think on stage i act too arrogant too selfobsessed solipsistic selfcontained synonyms and they want me to be they want me to be a comic of the people you know relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy so i want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys im like you guys you know once a week i like to slip into a deep existential depression where i loose all my sense of oneness and self worth haha and what i like to do in order to assure my self that i am unique and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in jesus and satans backgammon game is i will ill say a group a words that i think no one has ever said in that order so that when i say it i feel like look at me participating in this new moment that no ones ever been a part of so ill say something random like like peanutbutter tribadism or im your father and i loved your comedy show or at first i wasnt comfortable leaving him alone with my children but then i saw his mustache phew or um or yo check out this amish website or um or i work at a toll booth and i dont want to kill my self or thats too too real or yo man lifes about three things man three things gettin money gettin pussy and the dewey decimal system or um or hey can you hold my fanny pack im gonna go fuck a woman    um if i could break i want to tank you all for being here because i im so grateful that youd all come here and spend an hour of your time with me and if you are watching at home or whatever on a computer or something if you have made it this far that you very much for watching genuinely i this is my favorite thing to do and im so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it um ok i will now recede back into my stage persona   i just blacked out for  seconds thank you for coming love songs used to be so beautiful you know let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherised upon a table t s eliot beautiful love songs now a days just as beautiful guys usher justin bieber  you know them but these new artists theyve done something very strange to the format of the love song theyve changed it a bit and i try to capture how theyve changed the format of the love song with this love song i hope you enjoy it and mark the differences jason derulo i love your hair i love your name i love the way you say it i love your heart and youre so smart cos you gave away it i love your sis i love your dad and i love your mom but more then all of that i love the fact that you are dumb enough to not realise everything ive said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords but youll still love it and let me finger you yeaaa finger you finger you oh girl i hope you dont think that im rude when i tell you that i love you boo i also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved america says we love a chorus but dont get complicated and bore us though meaning might be missin we need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff yeah oh you know it i love my baby and you know i could not live without her but now i need to make every girl think this songs about her just to make sure that they spread it like the plague so i describe my dream girl as really really vague like i love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other i love your eyes and their blueishbrownishgreenish color i love it when you smile that you smile wide and i love how your torso has a arm on either side if youre my agent you might be thinking oh no sound the alarm youre not appealing to little girls who dont have arms but they cant use itunes so fuck them who needs them oh girl i ho oh hello satan  satan you taste so good repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff everybody  repeat stuff  repeat stuff  repeat stuff  repeat stuff cmon louder i cant hear you  repeat stuff  repeat stuff  repeat stuff  repeat stuff    young ones listen up im in magazines full of model teens so far above you so read them and hate your self and pay me to tell you i love you  and your parents will always come along because their little girl is in love and how can love be wrong how can love be wrong when you repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff repeat stuff rep  i am a vessel   illuminati we know its not right we know its not funny but well stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money but until then we will repeat stuff    thank you so much you guys have been um you guys have been absolutely amazing youve been absolutely amazing thats the end of the show i probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there but yeah thats the end of what i hope you liked it  bo  oh my god  how are you  i have not

passionate  theyre very um reliable consumers  but what you gotta do  in order to take your career  to the next level  you gotta cater more heavily to them  alright weve done studies  young people do not respond  to this you know introspective material  these challenges to the form you know  young people want jokes  they can relate to ok  so write a  write a silly song about facebook  you know

breeding getting them how we wanted to do jobs for us bit stronger faster whatever theyre great at the jobs theyre bred to do they love the job theyre bred to do theyre genetically hardwired to love

new standup for seven years if you dont count the golden globes which you shouldnt the golden globes\\u00a0very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and its live big thrill but with that many people watching theres a bit of stick everyones different everyones a blogger everyone goes i was offended why he said an horrible thing he said loads of horrible things yeah but that was a thing that i care about thats the thing about offense its about personal feelings i dont care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things what have you said dont worry they wont come to the house fuck em so i wind her up i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before its in la we fly out im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson ill introduce him yes about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said i got a good intro she went what i said bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren i didnt do it she said you wont do that i said no next day i got her again i said is this too much i said not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy i didnt do it i would never id never tell a joke like that its horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane id never even think of that so dont even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said ill start\\u00a0with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she went what i said what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane went i dont know i said cancer i didnt do it so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist so id never say that in public so to anyone who mattered anyway so dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going it was transphobic it wasnt transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and thats the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target theyre not necessarily the same ill tell you the joke you make your minds up its live so they go your host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais theyre all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously its brilliant right so i just go relax im gonna be nice tonight ive changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously and i go\\u00a0now caitlyn jenner of course and what a year shes had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke ill tell you why right its layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes im playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying shes a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if shes a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car lets not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress thats the target of the joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and one of the press said what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she went maybe i should host the golden globes and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously i just sent back let her host just dont let her drive another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying why is it transphobic they said its about a trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but im willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete\\u00a0he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big famous man with a huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was a man years ago im saying and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door the doctor went come in this is years ago id never deadname her now but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so like come in and he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then the doctor\\u2013 this was years ago the doctor went all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy and bruce jenner\\u2013 that was\\u00a0his name this is years ago right so bruce jenner went yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy and bruce jenner went\\u2013 that was his name bruce jenner went look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rules he uses his whole name every time for some reason come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate bruce jenner went no thats not my pole thats my enormous penis well seeing as its your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside and bruce jenner went that was his name for fiftyeight years i think he went no theyre not my shot puts doctor theyre my enormous testicles thats where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went oh yeah that makes perfect\\u2013 im a medical man youre a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy youre a big youre big and you would have a big old cock and balls theyre beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of them bruce bruce went this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them and the doctor went what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fucking driving for one thing so im engaging these people and im saying but i had to say her old name thats the joke i say ive changed not as much as bruce jenner then i do the joke but no this is my second crime i say she hasnt changed shes always identified\\u00a0as a woman that means shes a woman fine if thats the rules if you feel youre a woman you are im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i dont think its going far enough cause ive always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say im a chimp i am a chimp preop but dont ever deadname me dont call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo im gonna have species realignment im halfway there im short with short legs and long arms i stoop my backs getting hairier by the day ive got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like so i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say im a chimp ive got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy thatd be lovely im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp were so close than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out into\\u2013 im not a doctor but that is the gist of it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but to me every single one of you is equal to a chimp so so id have all that done hair and that id do all that all the ill retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies im talking to jane shes going what is it what is it bobo you left the fucking oven on theres a fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally a chimp ill be well properly chimpedup ill be able to use chimp toilets ill be walking along holding janes hand come on bobo right we dont hold hands now i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp but well be all in love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo in love just two like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him and run up a tree and thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheers so humanity what is humanity what are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die now my sevenyearold niece didnt like hearing that but i said youve gotta learn stop crying i said youre seven you know today so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled so lets take the first of those birth its odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early thats why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb thats why were so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes im proper pregnant right im gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes mum its got to be fucking ready were were helpless right just think nine months were growing in this perfect environment everythings its like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass youre covered in shit theres screaming you go i cant breathe someone goes yes you fucking can the first one second of life\\u00a0on earth you dont know where you are you cant choose where youre born i was\\u00a0born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldnt have chosen that id have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took\\u00a0 years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous its a rarefied place its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i dont know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didnt get mugged or molested there werent many pedophiles\\u00a0in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god theres no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him bender it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasnt always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying hes out of touch hes so famous hes rich hes megarich i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like hes an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum and i say i say dont call them scum right but even the papers they try and get around to it i do interviews and theyll always say do you always fly first class i go no often private right the number of times ive answered this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk is to make you look out of touch i dont know but thats irrelevant next time a journalist asks me ill say i dont know but heres\\u00a0a grand run and get me one is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece theyre still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like you dont have children i say no why dont you have children which is an odd question why dont you have children as opposed to asking people why do you have children lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didnt even touch the sides or disturb her cigarette that one just go and claim for that people say its selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesnt exist on any level theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going we want to be born right but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children three main reasons and ill share them with you three reasons one theres millions the worlds overpopulated noones going ricks not having kids were gonna run out fuck two kids are scroungers arent they i mean from day one its all me me me isnt it feed me clothe me pay for my chemotherapy no no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they dont want to pay you back theyre not grateful they dont go thanks for having me its i didnt wanna be born even if they get a top job which they wont youll never see that money back theyll just put you in a

die then social services come round and say is this your child mr gervais yeah what happened here then i go its a fucking idiot i did think of adopting for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three boxes one i wouldnt be adding to the population problem id be alleviating an existing problem a young kid born through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have died i can literally save his life and give him a great upbringing right two he would be grateful wouldnt he hed wanna pay me back woudnt he particularly if i let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the

and go shes beautiful its gotta be long\\u00a0too short its awkward they know you go yeah right too long and its like shes shes fucking beautiful its a minefield innit so im not out of touch but i am spoiled theres a difference i didnt have any money until i was  ive got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesnt take much il give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time youre horrified everyones looking pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went wheres that bloke im not queueing its quick when i fly to the states ive got a place there but im always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesnt get any better even if i was paying id still go first class but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movies on shell love that shell be up for that but when someone else is paying i say jane get up here with me right front two seats they board us early were on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne its great its like a day off no phone or anything its like\\u00a0a holiday flying to the statesi could do without the safety video thats always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked youre going down the plane smashes you go ill try it you do that ball of flames you wake up everyones dead you go fucking hell thats amazing that is and they always use that voice dont they that calming hypnotic voice like nothing bad will happen theyre saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because im using this voice dont worry things like in the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013 it smashes the fuck to bits right they say in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyones dead except you by a miracle youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is youve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or youre eaten by a shark or you drown youre hoping theyve sent airsea rescue youre going god im\\u00a0gonna die i dont know what im doing hold on i mean air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter o course you havent but theyre fucking loud its like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle its like like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that its brilliant right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais she goes off i go have you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts she went were not handing out nuts on this flight a ladys getting on whos so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction i went oh my god of course i was fuming i mean whats that got to do with me why cant i eat nuts just cause fucking this woman will die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly its and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean i never wanted nuts more i felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought oh i wish id brought my own nuts on right i thought for a second but that wouldnt work shed get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that and die and someone would go ricky gervais brought his own nuts on you know right so i dont take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case then i go can i have any nuts they go no sorry this lady would die yeah not a problem lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog i go whats the matter i touch her all over whats the matter she goes nuts right and dies and i go whos been eating nuts i get off scotfree so i got to america i went on a chat show tonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by outrage i mean one person going how dare you this woman goes i saw you on\\u00a0jimmy fallon making fun of nut allergies my daughters nutintolerant how dare you i go who is this woman shes tweeted  times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go whats this how many followers twentythree ignore it you know when youre being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going so you find so and so funny and cause the teachers really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever she said would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog yeah yeah you saying that yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and theyre talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause im this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies i should have left it right i sent back i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies she sent back yes\\u00a0but the holocaust didnt kill children well it did didnt it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies didnt kill children jesus it did kill children hitler killed  million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldnt make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but if i was throwing a dinner party and id been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more everyones enjoying it everything okay ja ist\\u00a0yummy right hes loving it i go cheers you fucker how you doing boy shes going i cant eat that fucking hell who wants ferrero rocher me all right here i cant eat them oh fuck off home rightthats what the worlds like people see something they dont like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do its why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think ive lived through the best  years of humanity  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now its going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe im not saying this because im old old people say things like oh everything was better when i was a kid course it was you were a kid everythings better when youre a kid being old is the shit bit whatevers happening being old is i wake up these days and i go oh fuck i didnt die gotta do it all again im usually hung over headache liver pains i cant walk for the first five minutes cause ive got no joints in my knees im getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about \\u00a0proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor and i was saying to jane im having a heart attack right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because id eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like python swallow a pig whole and then its just fucked its like itll sit there for a week its like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasnt having a heart attack but it worried jane she said you gotta look after yourself i thought youre right  so i started working out right every day i didnt give anything up i dont eat meat anymore but i was having   calories\\u00a0a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically cant\\u00a0burn off the calories i cant do enough cause im so old and broken and tired so im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die im losing my hair its getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right ill have to buzz that off soon id never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think youve got away with it you havent everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party itll go theres a wig in here i go is there yes there is yeah spidey senses for the wig its obvious the way they smile like nothings wrong hiya its the telltale signs isnt it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke hes dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what is\\u2013 i was about eight i said to auntie edna what happened she went it was a miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he wouldnt do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we werent allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said reg is allergic to balloons he wasnt allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room weve got photos in the family album if hes at a wedding or a christening and hes holding a baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasnt scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows the chemo going uncle not a problem weve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it hes wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared and it was a shock to me i only found out recently ill share it with you now the distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years as a young man they were pert and now theyre like two plums in a sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just and this is how i found out so as ive been getting older and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them and theyd sink you know most people never see their in the sea youre in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked in hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on the bottom theyre on top whats going on right and i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact theyd created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle im just thinking this is bizarre fucking hell right and i thought maybe its a fluke so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them and now in this posttruth era people dont care about the argument they say whos saying the argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now its my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe the earth is  years old i believe youre a fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didnt want to make a mistake and theres a ridiculous thing of lets ask the average person what they think lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but its not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you the news i saw a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said weve looked at everything and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so were going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but the guy went we asked the public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay \\u00a3 a year so im not happy the next one said it takes me  minutes each way its not good enough the last one said i say its better to arrive at work late than dead why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted youre in early ted oh ted weve been through this remember i said id rather you arrive late than dead but the big enemy is stupidity right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyones opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say its fine to be an atheist its fine to believe in god and its fine not to thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this is a tweet i got\\u00a0after one of those and it was all in capitals which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes a gentleman from texas hes a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then hes remember its in capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science\\u2013 my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard the word he took a guess never seen it written down because its not in the bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days youre not gonna say to him do you believe in satan and have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong and i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what what is wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan and hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff which you want i mean you do want\\u2013 yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass and hes got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes a fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh my god im in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped and goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it is he his days suddenly got a little bit brighter and like hes not next right so im getting raped right by the devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum and im like that yeah whatever i assume it happens all eternity yeah yeah whatever like that i might say watch your hooves on my testicles and hed go why are they so distended and i go oh like youre brad pitt you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we you lying fucking atheist hes probably bored fucking atheists every fucking day right his little gargoyle comes up satan he goes what and i go yeah what he goes theres a fundamentalist christian fuck this hed be on him like a ton of bricks so i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going ah loser and hes fighting back really witlessly saying things like go fuck your sister you english faggot that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again its still all going off right its really funny im laughing at all the replies people saying things to him im scrolling down theres one tweet directly to me from this woman she says you find rape funny no no what no your mates find rape funny no listen right you find rape funny listen everyone listen right no i said to her i didnt tweet that she went you retweeted it to show hes an idiot but you must find it funny or amusing its not a frivolous thing i said no well its up to him isnt it he can do it now im arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didnt say what you find jokes about rape funny she said what you find rape funny the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on the joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on the joke its about context\\u00a0its about content what do you mean by a rape joke she said even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what the joke is i tweeted that clip of me in the office going i think theres been a rape up there everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said\\u00a0some jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play\\u00a0on words that dont really mean anything a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it ill tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says help ive been graped the policeman says do you mean raped she says no there was a bunch of them that is a rape joke right so and i even said to her no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting id never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying well okay i see your point but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it when noone in the audience has been raped i should have left it i just sent back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says can i just ask you a question yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you cant come in what why a lady says she wont laugh if youre in off you go thats what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally thats like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons and you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing in twitters defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tescos or something thats the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about the kids in syria what well im not giving you a choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back in the hole theres a bull here and theres one thing that i didnt want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and its horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back its a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people dont really read it its a kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs and cows in the west yep we do i dont but yeah i used to youre right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog its not about the species its what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its the worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got to tweet that i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said is that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death she said i just hate the cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not the point ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor mans will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and hed get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought hed won the argument and hed tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought if it looked\\u00a0respectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read is that pedophile postman still reading your mail and shed take it shed go in and shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right wed never been to church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said to bob tell me about your mum so i can say a few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said well she was a keen racist the vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didnt warn us and he did get something by the vicar so were called ricky robert\\u2013 bob\\u2013 ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out hes a standup guy larry so bob gives the vicar the wrong name didnt warn us were all in church start of the funeral were all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and we snort like that right bobs going everyone realizes were all laughing we see larry go all right and the church is like every time we thought of it wed see larry go like that right then wed just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicars thinking what have i said right hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying id come prepared with a pack of tissues theyd take one and hand it on before the funeral id taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said snivelling fucking bitch and theyre sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said sorry was that okay me and bob went\\u00a0fucking brilliant\\u00a0mate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were all\\u00a0gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity youre bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny youve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right so were all in the car one day bobs driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and theres a british bobby there and he stops the car bobs at the window he said where are we off to bob went bognor he went\\u00a0can you just pop the boot please so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bobs window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\\u2019s 22 years old. He\\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you\\u2019re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE! Welcome to the show this is Bo, this is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this. Welcome to the show, this is Bo this is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this. Play an invisible drum.

Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?

Please leave.\\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \\u201cHello, Bo!\\u201d \\u2018I\\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe.

[Screeching] It\\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\\u2019s a hint. He\\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \\u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\\u2019re having fun\\u2026 This, um- This show is called \\u201cwhat\\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical.

Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That\\u2019s your opinion\\u2026 So just\\u2026 Be careful with opinions\\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \\u201cYou\\u2019re incomparable.\\u201d \\u201cLike a \\u2026 \\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\\u201d \\u201cI want to grab one of those\\u201d \\u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\\u201d \\u201cand bash your rib cage in!\\u201d \\u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\\u201d \\u201cbind them with a rubber band\\u201d \\u201cstick the lead in your mouth\\u201d \\u201cand punch the erasers!\\u201d \\u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\\u201d \\u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\\u201d \\u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\\u201d \\u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\\u201d \\u201cI want you to somehow survive\\u201d \\u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\\u201d \\u201cnot survive a small fender bender\\u201d \\u201con the way back from a hospital.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\\u2019s called \\u201cDad\\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \\u201cOh no!\\u201d \\u201cSound the alarm!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not appealing\\u201d \\u201cto little girls\\u201d \\u201cwho don\\u2019t have arms.\\u201d But they can\\u2019t use iTunes, so\\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody! [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 [Audience] .repeat stuff.. [Audience] ..repeat stuff. [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 C\\u2019mon, louder. I can\\u2019t hear you.

I\\u2019m in magazines, full of model teens so far above you. So read them and hate your self. And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: \\u201cI love you\\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .rep\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026I am a vessel\\u2026 \\u2026.666\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026Illuminati\\u2026 We know it\\u2019s not right. We know it\\u2019s not funny. But we\\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\\u2026 Um\\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\\u2019s the end of \\u201cwhat.\\u201d I hope you liked it\\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Girl voice] I\\u2019ve been telling everybody [Girl voice] how good a friends we were [Girl voice] Back in the day. [Girl voice] I know we never talked [Girl voice] or hung out ever, but\\u2026 Um\\u2026 [Girl voice] I think that\\u2019s what made [Girl voice] our friendship so special, you know. [Girl voice] Anyway, text me. OK. Bye. [Guy voice] Mr. Burnham? [Guy voice] How you doing? [Guy voice] Good? Good. [Guy voice] I\\u2019m a\\u2026 I\\u2019m a agent [Guy voice] from out Los Angeles. [Guy voice] Really dig your stuff man. [Guy voice] It\\u2019s out there. You know. [Guy voice] I totally get it. [Guy voice] And the best part about it man, [Guy voice] you got all these young fans. [Guy voice] And\\u2026 Which is great [Guy voice] Because young people, [Guy voice] they\\u2019re\\u2026 they\\u2019re very passionate, [Guy voice] they\\u2019re very\\u2026 Um\\u2026 reliable consumers. [Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know. [Guy voice] Young people want jokes [Guy voice] they can relate to. OK? [Guy voice] So\\u2026 Write a\\u2026 [Guy voice] Write a silly song about Facebook [Guy voice] you know, write some jokes [Guy voice] about Twitter, [Guy voice] or sugary cereal, [Guy voice] or razor scooters. [Guy voice] Relate to them. [Guy voice] You know, also [Guy voice] you gotta reestablish your presence [Guy voice] on the internet buddy. Alright? [Guy voice] It\\u2019s not important weather [Guy voice] the material is good or not. [Guy voice] What\\u2019s important is [Guy voice] that you keep the Bo Burnham brand [Guy voice] Alive and well. [Guy voice] You get it? Cool. [Guy voice] We\\u2019ll discuss more later [Guy voice] I know it\\u2019s a lot. [Guy voice] My number is 310\\u2026 555\\u2026 [Bro voice] Fag! [Bro voice] What up dude!

[Bro voice] But my friends old room mate\\u2019s friend [Bro voice] said he knew you in highschool [Bro voice] and that you became a real asshole [Bro voice] once all this comedy stuff started happening. [Bro voice] What is it man? [Bro voice] You think you are better then us? [Bro voice] You think you are better then us [Bro voice] just because you are tall?

Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019ve had our money\\u2019s worth just seeing you.\\u201d What? You\\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\\u2019m not a god. I\\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\\u2026 sort of like Jesus\\u2026 in a way\\u2026 but better. Well, I\\u2019ve actually turned up. So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\\u2019t they? They\\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\\u2019ve got\\u2026 AIDS. I\\u2019m not a doctor\\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \\u201cCor, you\\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\\u201d You know? And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do. We all do.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, Labradors.\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\\u201d \\u201cJack Russells?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d -\\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah!\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\\u201d -\\u201cMiniature poodles?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d That\\u2019s your job. \\u201cRidgebacks?\\u201d \\u201cYo!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cFuck off!\\u201d -\\u201cYeah, you are.\\u201d -\\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaking babies.\\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\\u2019s different, everyone\\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \\u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\\u201d And Bob went, \\u201cI knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains.\\u201d You\\u2019ve been amazing. Good night!

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\\u2019s 22 years old. He\\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps.

And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?

Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?!

But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical. Aware of patterns. [Robotic voice] Aware of trends. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s efficient. [Robotic voice] And a prick. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s right brain. [Robotic voice] Subjective. Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That\\u2019s your opinion\\u2026 So just\\u2026 Be careful with opinions\\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \\u201cYou\\u2019re incomparable.\\u201d \\u201cLike a \\u2026 \\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\\u201d \\u201cI want to grab one of those\\u201d \\u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\\u201d \\u201cand bash your rib cage in!\\u201d \\u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\\u201d \\u201cbind them with a rubber band\\u201d \\u201cstick the lead in your mouth\\u201d \\u201cand punch the erasers!\\u201d \\u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\\u201d \\u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\\u201d \\u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\\u201d \\u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\\u201d \\u201cI want you to somehow survive\\u201d \\u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\\u201d \\u201cnot survive a small fender bender\\u201d \\u201con the way back from a hospital.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\\u2019s called \\u201cDad\\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other.

[Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know. [Guy voice] Young people want jokes [Guy voice] they can relate to. OK? [Guy voice] So\\u2026 Write a\\u2026 [Guy voice] Write a silly song about Facebook [Guy voice] you know, write some jokes [Guy voice] about Twitter, [Guy voice] or sugary cereal, [Guy voice] or razor scooters.

[Bro voice] What is it man? [Bro voice] You think you are better then us? [Bro voice] You think you are better then us [Bro voice] just because you are tall? [Bro voice] Woah, congrats man, you are tall. [Bro voice] Wow! That\\u2019s incredible. [Bro voice] Woah! You want a trophy [Bro voice] for being tall?

An arrogant fucking prick! [Bro voice] I once herd that you [Bro voice] actually act quiet because [Bro voice] you are shy and introverted in real life, [Bro voice] and that people should not expect [Bro voice] you to act the same way [Bro voice] off stage as you do on stage.

Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019ve had our money\\u2019s worth just seeing you.\\u201d What? You\\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\\u2019m not a god. I\\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\\u2026 sort of like Jesus\\u2026 in a way\\u2026 but better. Well, I\\u2019ve actually turned up. So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\\u2019t they? They\\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\\u2019ve got\\u2026 AIDS. I\\u2019m not a doctor\\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \\u201cCor, you\\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\\u201d You know? And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do. We all do.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, Labradors.\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\\u201d \\u201cJack Russells?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d -\\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah!\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\\u201d -\\u201cMiniature poodles?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d That\\u2019s your job. \\u201cRidgebacks?\\u201d \\u201cYo!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cFuck off!\\u201d -\\u201cYeah, you are.\\u201d -\\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaking babies.\\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\\u2019s different, everyone\\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \\u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\\u201d And Bob went, \\u201cI knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains.\\u201d You\\u2019ve been amazing. Good night!

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Random voice Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a healthy dose of prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. Lick your lips to make it more comforting. Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Then pick a card any card. SIKE! Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? Do you have any spare change?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s a used napkin.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t want that.\\u201d \\u201cNo. No, stop. Just-\\u201d \\u201cYou know, leave. Just leave. Please leave.\\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \\u201cHello, Bo!\\u201d \\u2018I\\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe. For now\\u2026 But the dark thoughts would soon return. IT\\u2019S GODZILLA! AAAAHHHHH!!! AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [Screeching] OH MY GOD AHHHHH!!!! [Screeching] GODZILLA!! AAAAAUUUGGHHHHHH!!! [Screeching] It\\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\\u2019s a hint. He\\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \\u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\\u2019re having fun\\u2026 This, um- This show is called \\u201cwhat\\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical. Aware of patterns. [Robotic voice] Aware of trends. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s efficient. [Robotic voice] And a prick. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s right brain. [Robotic voice] Subjective. Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That\\u2019s your opinion\\u2026 So just\\u2026 Be careful with opinions\\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \\u201cYou\\u2019re incomparable.\\u201d \\u201cLike a \\u2026 \\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\\u201d \\u201cI want to grab one of those\\u201d \\u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\\u201d \\u201cand bash your rib cage in!\\u201d \\u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\\u201d \\u201cbind them with a rubber band\\u201d \\u201cstick the lead in your mouth\\u201d \\u201cand punch the erasers!\\u201d \\u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\\u201d \\u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\\u201d \\u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\\u201d \\u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\\u201d \\u201cI want you to somehow survive\\u201d \\u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\\u201d \\u201cnot survive a small fender bender\\u201d \\u201con the way back from a hospital.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\\u2019s called \\u201cDad\\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \\u201cOh no!\\u201d \\u201cSound the alarm!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not appealing\\u201d \\u201cto little girls\\u201d \\u201cwho don\\u2019t have arms.\\u201d But they can\\u2019t use iTunes, so\\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody! [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 [Audience] .repeat stuff.. [Audience] ..repeat stuff. [Audience] repeat stuff\\u2026 C\\u2019mon, louder. I can\\u2019t hear you.

I\\u2019m in magazines, full of model teens so far above you. So read them and hate your self. And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: \\u201cI love you\\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .rep\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026I am a vessel\\u2026 \\u2026.666\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026Illuminati\\u2026 We know it\\u2019s not right. We know it\\u2019s not funny. But we\\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\\u2026 Um\\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\\u2019s the end of \\u201cwhat.\\u201d I hope you liked it\\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know. [Guy voice] Young people want jokes [Guy voice] they can relate to. OK?

Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019ve had our money\\u2019s worth just seeing you.\\u201d What? You\\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\\u2019m not a god. I\\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\\u2026 sort of like Jesus\\u2026 in a way\\u2026 but better. Well, I\\u2019ve actually turned up. So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\\u2019t they? They\\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\\u2019ve got\\u2026 AIDS. I\\u2019m not a doctor\\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \\u201cCor, you\\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\\u201d You know? And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do.

Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \\u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\\u201d And Bob went, \\u201cI knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains.\\u201d You\\u2019ve been amazing. Good night!

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\\u2019s 22 years old. He\\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you\\u2019re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE!

And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?

Please leave.\\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \\u201cHello, Bo!\\u201d \\u2018I\\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe.

[Screeching] It\\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\\u2019s a hint. He\\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \\u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\\u2019re having fun\\u2026 This, um- This show is called \\u201cwhat\\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical.

I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \\u201cYou\\u2019re incomparable.\\u201d \\u201cLike a \\u2026 \\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\\u201d \\u201cI want to grab one of those\\u201d \\u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\\u201d \\u201cand bash your rib cage in!\\u201d \\u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\\u201d \\u201cbind them with a rubber band\\u201d \\u201cstick the lead in your mouth\\u201d \\u201cand punch the erasers!\\u201d \\u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\\u201d \\u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\\u201d \\u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\\u201d \\u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\\u201d \\u201cI want you to somehow survive\\u201d \\u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\\u201d \\u201cnot survive a small fender bender\\u201d \\u201con the way back from a hospital.\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\\u2019s called \\u201cDad\\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \\u201cOh no!\\u201d \\u201cSound the alarm!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not appealing\\u201d \\u201cto little girls\\u201d \\u201cwho don\\u2019t have arms.\\u201d But they can\\u2019t use iTunes, so\\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody!

I\\u2019m in magazines, full of model teens so far above you. So read them and hate your self. And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: \\u201cI love you\\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .rep\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026I am a vessel\\u2026 \\u2026.666\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026Illuminati\\u2026 We know it\\u2019s not right. We know it\\u2019s not funny. But we\\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\\u2026 Um\\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\\u2019s the end of \\u201cwhat.\\u201d I hope you liked it\\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know.

Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\\u2019re thinking, \\u201cRelax, we\\u2019ve had our money\\u2019s worth just seeing you.\\u201d What? You\\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\\u2019m not a god. I\\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\\u2026 sort of like Jesus\\u2026 in a way\\u2026 but better. Well, I\\u2019ve actually turned up. So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\\u2019t they? They\\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\\u2019ve got\\u2026 AIDS. I\\u2019m not a doctor\\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \\u201cCor, you\\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\\u201d You know? And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do. We all do.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, Labradors.\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\\u201d \\u201cJack Russells?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d -\\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah!\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\\u201d -\\u201cMiniature poodles?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d That\\u2019s your job. \\u201cRidgebacks?\\u201d \\u201cYo!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cFuck off!\\u201d -\\u201cYeah, you are.\\u201d -\\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaking babies.\\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\\u2019s different, everyone\\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \\u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\\u201d And Bob went, \\u201cI knew it wasn\\u2019t fucking brains.\\u201d You\\u2019ve been amazing. Good night!

Rory Scovel\\u2019s first hourlong stand-up special, directed by Scott Moran and filmed at the Woolfe Street Playhouse in Charleston, SC. The special was produced entirely, from building the set to hanging lights, by Rory and a crew of his closest friends. David Cross: Worst Daddy in the World showcases David Cross\\u2019s return to the stage, blending humor with candid observations about fatherhood, societal quirks, and personal flaws. Dan Soder muses on wanting simplicity, the perks of attractiveness, quirky life anecdotes, aging, tech fears, and finding humor in daily absurdities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Bill Burr\",\n          \"Bo Burnham\",\n          \"Ricky Gervais\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.03019353918524196,\n        \"min\": -0.0009428532196389281,\n        \"max\": 0.07628477086893527,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.017394186523501016,\n          0.07628477086893527,\n          0.0677742486146133\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjectivity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.015596862374067598,\n        \"min\": 0.49785040908805706,\n        \"max\": 0.5391737278330938,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5376389528762496,\n          0.5391737278330938,\n          0.49785040908805706\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\\u2019s nice to be here. I don\\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \\u201cLook at \\u2019em just over there, drinkin\\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\\u201d So\\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\\u2019clock, that\\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \\u201cV\\u201d ones, right? They said it\\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \\u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\\u201d Right? They just won\\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \\u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\\u201d \\u2013 That\\u2019s it! That is it. \\u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\\u2019t do it, they won\\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \\u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\\u2019re already out!\\u201d You can\\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \\u201cWe\\u2019re part of a group, eh.\\u201d You gotta apologize. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\\u2019t mean to say that it\\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna join a group, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna do today.\\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\\u2019s like, dude, that\\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \\u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\\u201d Dude, that\\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\\u2019t know anybody who\\u2019s graduating. You\\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, it\\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \\u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \\u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\\u2019t work. It\\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\\u2019s just like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\\u2026 you\\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d [shouts angrily] That\\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\\u2019re not reading anything? They don\\u2019t see the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Hit Your Wife\\u201d billboard? They\\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \\u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\\u2019t even open his eyes when he\\u2019s talking. \\u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \\u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\\u2019s getting in trouble \\u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \\u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \\u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\\u201d \\u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\\u2019t know, I don\\u2019t know how I feel about it.\\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\\u2019t offensive. I\\u2019m not sayin\\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\\u201d Yeah, they\\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\\u2013 I\\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\\u2019t drop the \\u201cN\\u201d word once. That\\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \\u201cN\\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \\u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\\u201d \\u201cHey, what about Facebook?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \\u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \\u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\\u2026 ~\\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \\u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \\u201cHey, you can hang out with \\u2019em, you can have sex with \\u2019em, man, you know?\\u201d His dad\\u2019s getting all pissed off: \\u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\\u201d That\\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s all you know. \\u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\\u2019s going on out in the world. You\\u2019re stuck with these kids. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\\u2019t touch that!\\u201d You\\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\\u2013 You don\\u2019t know what happened. You\\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\\u2019m 46 years old. I don\\u2019t even have kids, but I can\\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\\u2019m like, all right, I\\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \\u201cAll right, put it on!\\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\\u2019m like this old man. \\u201cAh, this isn\\u2019t music!\\u201d You know? \\u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\\u2019s passing me by. I\\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\\u2019t give a shit, but I\\u2019m a sports fan. That\\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \\u201cHold still!\\u201d \\u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\\u2019m not saying that I\\u2019m right. I know I\\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \\u201cCan you believe?\\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\\u2019t he think\\u2026 Didn\\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\\u2019t it come from that shit? There\\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\\u2019s not his fault that he went to\\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\\u2019t clap, don\\u2019t clap, I don\\u2019t read, I don\\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \\u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\\u201d \\u201c~ All right, I\\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a big boy.\\u201d \\u201cLooks like people like me!\\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \\u201cWhack whack!\\u201d Mine goes, \\u201cWhack-a-fuckin\\u2019-whack!\\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \\u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\\u2019t like the queers.\\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what they said!\\u201d And they\\u2019re all dead. \\u201cOh, where\\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\\u201d He\\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \\u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\\u201d They\\u2019re not gonna do that. That\\u2019s the Vatican. They\\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\\u2019s nothing. They\\u2019re not taking that call. \\u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\\u201d Click. They don\\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\\u2019re into, you\\u2019re into, but I\\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\\u2019t like to go\\u2013 I didn\\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\\u2019t. Part of it was I\\u2019m lazy. I don\\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \\u2013 Right? \\u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\\u2019t kill anybody. Don\\u2019t touch my wife. That\\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\\u2019ve broken, I think I\\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\\u2019s it. I haven\\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Shh\\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \\u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \\u201cMotherfucker!\\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\\u2019s, he got sick of it. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\\u201d Look, I\\u2019m paraphrasing, I\\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\\u2019s sneakers. There\\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \\u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\\u2019t come true!\\u201d Right? And I was just like, \\u201cWow, this is how the world is.\\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \\u201cThat\\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\\u2026\\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \\u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\\u2019t go anymore.\\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \\u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\\u2026\\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\\u2019s like, I\\u2019m in this weird place where I\\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead and that\\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\\u2013 just layin\\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cReally? You\\u2019re just dead?\\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\\u2019s true, that somebody\\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\\u2019t even make any sense. It\\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\\u2019t think this thing\\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\\u2019t run, I wouldn\\u2019t burn it forever. \\u201cYou evil piece of shit!\\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \\u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\\u201d Yes, my religion, it\\u2019s nuts. It\\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \\u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\\u2019t make it. And then what, I\\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \\u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\\u2019t this great? Isn\\u2019t this great?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, Dude, it\\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \\u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\\u2019t give a fuck! I\\u2019m already in here, I\\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \\u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo,\\u201d and the guy\\u2019s like, \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s just like that.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\\u2019m getting as I get older. I\\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\\u2019t believe in the pilots. \\u2018Cause you know what? I don\\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\\u2019ll be in a jet\\u2013\\u201d Whoo! We\\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\\u2019re getting the fuckin\\u2019 pilot that knows what he\\u2019s doing. He\\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\\u2019t bring this bus in? It\\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \\u201cMy headphones don\\u2019t work!\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\\u2019s up there sleeping. He\\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\\u2019s made of, like\\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \\u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\\u201d I\\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\\u2026 \\u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \\u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m not up here thinking\\u2026 \\u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\\u2026 whooo\\u2026 whaaaa\\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\\u2019s all car stuff. \\u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\\u2019t fit.\\u201d \\u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\\u2019t fit? Dad\\u2019s gonna be mad.\\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\\u2019s so fucking stupid. \\u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\\u201d So, before\\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\\u2026 whoo\\u2026 whaaa\\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \\u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \\u201cWell, he\\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\\u2019re rolling the dice. You\\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \\u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\\u2019t know, man, that\\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \\u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \\u201cHow was your day? What\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \\u2019em down, right? \\u201cCome on, it didn\\u2019t hurt, get up!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t come from a family, I don\\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\\u2026 \\u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \\u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\\u2019m in the shower. I don\\u2019t know what it is. I think \\u2019cause I\\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\\u2019s always just like, \\u201cIs everything okay in there?\\u201d I\\u2019ll just be like, \\u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\\u201d \\u201cEvery day?\\u201d So\\u2026 Yeah\\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \\u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\\u2019t do that stuff?\\u201d She was like, \\u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYou were afraid?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cWell, it was your father. That\\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\\u2019s compromises.\\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \\u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \\u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\\u2013\\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\\u201d So he took it from that\\u2026 and knocked it down to, \\u201cDon\\u2019t hug him, it\\u2019s gonna make him gay.\\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\\u2019s not taking drama class \\u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\\u201d I won\\u2019t fix everything. And that\\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\\u2019t. I would send\\u2026 I\\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \\u201cYou ever do that again, I\\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\\u2019s like 45 years old. \\u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \\u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \\u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\\u2019s just\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\\u2019d just be like, \\u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\\u201d So now I\\u2019m married, so the next move is you\\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\\u2019m 46 years old. I\\u2019m just thinking it\\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \\u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\\u2019s standing there, \\u201cMom, Dad\\u2019s sleeping again!\\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \\u201cHey, man, it\\u2019s kind of cold out today.\\u201d \\u201cDude, you don\\u2019t understand. You don\\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\\u2019s face.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\\u2019d love to adopt. It\\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \\u2019em off. \\u201cMine just turned six.\\u201d \\u201cMine just turned seven.\\u201d I\\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \\u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\\u2019re just there, like\\u2026! With all their issues\\u2026!\\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \\u201907, \\u201908\\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \\u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\\u2019re coming home with me!\\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \\u201cHave a seat.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cI get to sit down?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\\u201d He\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cloud! It\\u2019s like a cloud!\\u201d I\\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\\u2019d probably get like an \\u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \\u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\\u2019t even start that shit! Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \\u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\\u2019t, he doesn\\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\\u2019t. Because he doesn\\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\\u2019t give him back, it doesn\\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\\u2019s up, buddy? What\\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\\u201d So I figure, uh\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\\u2019m all over the fuckin\\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\\u2019s \\u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\\u2019re all right. I don\\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\\u2019re on the outskirts, you\\u2019re fine. You\\u2019re fine. You don\\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\\u2019s nowhere to go. That\\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \\u201cfuck this, I\\u2019m out\\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \\u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\\u2019s just like, \\u201cYeah, no.\\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \\u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\\u201d Yeah, I\\u2019m still gonna do it, I\\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\\u2019m not going to tell her. I\\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\\u2019s just gonna be like, \\u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, someday you\\u2019ll see, someday you\\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d \\u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\\u201d Now you guys think I\\u2019m bullshitting, I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m serious. I\\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \\u201cThey\\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\\u201d I\\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \\u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\\u201d It\\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \\u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \\u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \\u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\\u2019s Orange County. There\\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\\u201d Air traffic control: \\u201cI don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \\u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \\u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \\u201cTake me up in the chopper.\\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \\u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t!\\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\\u2019s got to be thinking, \\u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \\u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\\u2019s right. So here\\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\\u2019t want\\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\\u201d Can\\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \\u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\\u2019s not enough? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\\u2019s not enough, right? You want\\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \\u2018Cause that\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \\u201cHang on a second, let me just\\u2026\\u201d Yeah, you\\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \\u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\\u201d You know what\\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \\u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\\u2019t understand what the\\u2013 It\\u2019s not a real compelling story.\\u201d I\\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \\u201cLet\\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\\u2019m like, all right, let\\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\\u2019t get louder, didn\\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\\u2019s coming in too, right? That\\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \\u201cI\\u2019m out of my mind, I\\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gonna get crazy.\\u201d That\\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re just\\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\\u2026 [snoring] He\\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter? What\\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\\u2019re shaking. What\\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\\u2019s\\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\\u2019t see, now you can\\u2019t hear. That\\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\\u2019t get off the fact that it\\u2019s a fuckin\\u2019 .22. You\\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \\u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \\u201cLook, I\\u2019m coming back, I\\u2019m coming back!\\u201d I\\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \\u201cI guess we\\u2019re making holiday cookies.\\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \\u201cShe makes them and then I\\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\\u2013\\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t believe it. It\\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \\u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \\u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\\u201d It\\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\\u2019m bigger than you. I\\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\\u201d Yeah, I was like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\\u201d She\\u2019s like, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\\u2019re both half naked. She\\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \\u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\\u201d It\\u2019s fuckin\\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\\u2019ll be, \\u201cHey, how\\u2019s it been going?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\\u201d No, I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\\u2019s gonna come at you. \\u201cWell, let\\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \\u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\\u2019s like, it\\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\\u201d All right? I\\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\\u2019s gone. What\\u2019s the next fear? She\\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \\u201cJoin me!\\u201d Yeah. I\\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \\u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\\u201d She\\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \\u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\u201d Rest of the shit\\u2013 I\\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\\u2019s cool, everything\\u2019s cool, just, \\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\\u201d That\\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\\u2019s an olive branch I\\u2019ve extended to her. It\\u2019s basically\\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\\u2019t care, the nerd\\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\\u2019t mind them, it\\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \\u2018Cause they can\\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\\u2019s sexuality. That\\u2019s never brought up. That whole \\u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d She says, like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\\u2019t you want to do it? It\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d Why don\\u2019t I want to do it? I don\\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \\u201cOh, my God, it\\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\\u2019ll support me, it\\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\\u2019s gonna do is this, she\\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\\u2019s what she\\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\\u2019re like, \\u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\\u2019re heavy. You\\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\\u2019re, like, five or six? \\u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 yeah!\\u201d Yeah, it\\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\\u2019s ruined, and you\\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you.

Rory Scovel\\u2019s first hourlong stand-up special, directed by Scott Moran and filmed at the Woolfe Street Playhouse in Charleston, SC. The special was produced entirely, from building the set to hanging lights, by Rory and a crew of his closest friends. David Cross: Worst Daddy in the World showcases David Cross\\u2019s return to the stage, blending humor with candid observations about fatherhood, societal quirks, and personal flaws. Dan Soder muses on wanting simplicity, the perks of attractiveness, quirky life anecdotes, aging, tech fears, and finding humor in daily absurdities.\",\n          \"Bo What? Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\\u2019s 22 years old. He\\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you\\u2019re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE! Welcome to the show this is Bo, this is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this. Welcome to the show, this is Bo this is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this. Play an invisible drum. [Invisible drum sounds] Play an invisible trumpet. Trumpet sound! Drink some invisible water, OH SHIT! That water is real! Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Random voice Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a healthy dose of prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. Lick your lips to make it more comforting. Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Then pick a card any card. SIKE! Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\\u2019t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo\\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\\u2026 What the fuck you\\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \\u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\\u2019m not a troll.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m homeless.\\u201d \\u201cOkay? Do you have any spare change?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s a used napkin.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t want that.\\u201d \\u201cNo. No, stop. Just-\\u201d \\u201cYou know, leave. Just leave. Please leave.\\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \\u201cHello, Bo!\\u201d \\u2018I\\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe. For now\\u2026 But the dark thoughts would soon return. IT\\u2019S GODZILLA! AAAAHHHHH!!! AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [Screeching] OH MY GOD AHHHHH!!!! [Screeching] GODZILLA!! AAAAAUUUGGHHHHHH!!! [Screeching] It\\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\\u2019s a hint. He\\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \\u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\\u2019d like to, uh, I\\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\\u2019t you hate it when you\\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\\u2019re having fun\\u2026 This, um- This show is called \\u201cwhat\\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\\u2013 Just, don\\u2019t, if it\\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\\u2026 we can cut all this, so\\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\\u2026 I\\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \\u201cA world on fire\\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\\u2019s a little bit\\u2026 it\\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\\u2026 Thank you. It\\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\\u2019m really sad, it\\u2019s called \\u201cSad\\u201d [Piano music] It\\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\\u2019t hear me shout: \\u201clook out for the train!\\u201d Cos I didn\\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \\u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\\u201d And it was. I\\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\\u2019t been sad at all, you\\u2019ve been\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been happy. No\\u2026 You\\u2019ve been laughing. That\\u2019s it, laughter. That\\u2019s the key to everything. It\\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9/11, that shit\\u2019s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\\u2019ll go back to the\\u2026 Oops\\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\\u2019s called: \\u201cI fuck sluts\\u201d [audience member yells] It\\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\\u2019ve missed. I\\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you dare. They\\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they\\u2019ll be gone and you\\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\\u2026 [laughter] This\\u2019s for you: Here\\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \\u201cshucks\\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \\u201cshucks\\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\\u2019re having fun. Umm\\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \\u201creally dad?\\u201d \\u201cProve it!\\u201d [laughter] He sad: \\u201cWell what about that joke\\u201d \\u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\\u201d I said: \\u201cwell I haven\\u2019t written that joke yet,\\u201d \\u201ccos it\\u2019s based of this conversation!\\u201d \\u201cGotcha!\\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\\u2019t worry, you don\\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \\u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\\u201d \\u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \\u201cMeh\\u2026 alright\\u2026\\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\\u2019s called: \\u201cWhat did I do last night?\\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \\u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\\u201d I said: \\u201cOf course.\\u201d \\u201cYou and dad love each other\\u201d \\u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\\u201d \\u201cthat your father and I love each other.\\u201d She said: \\u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\\u201d \\u201cUmm.. they get into bed\\u201d \\u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\\u201d [laughter] So I don\\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn\\u2019t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just\\u2026 I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati\\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I\\u2019m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the\\u2026 What, what\\u2019s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right\\u2026 ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa\\u2026 [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 \\u2026 1] You don\\u2019t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don\\u2019t even know what \\u201cit\\u201d is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just\\u2026 [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical. Aware of patterns. [Robotic voice] Aware of trends. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s efficient. [Robotic voice] And a prick. [Robotic voice] This is Bo\\u2019s right brain. [Robotic voice] Subjective. Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He\\u2019s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That\\u2019s your opinion\\u2026 So just\\u2026 Be careful with opinions\\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\\u2019s something about her, I just can\\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\\u2026 sit\\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\\u2019re happy. Cos he\\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\\u2019s feeling. How he\\u2019s feeling? If he\\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\\u2019m sorry. No you\\u2019re not\\u2026 Look, maybe there\\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\\u2019m listening\\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\\u2019ll man the form. It\\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\\u2019m pretty fucking deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 deep\\u2026 So deep\\u2026 That I called this song\\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\\u2026 That\\u2019s why you\\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\\u2026 You don\\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\\u2019s called: \\u201cBeating off in A minor\\u201d. Yes\\u2026 Yes\\u2026 \\u201cA-minor\\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\\u2026 I believe\\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\\u2019d like to do\\u2026 erm\\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\\u2026 if that\\u2019s OK? We\\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\\u2026 I\\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \\u201cEgghead\\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\\u2019s all just sort of\\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \\u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go chase cars.\\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \\u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\\u201d \\u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\\u201d [Chimes] \\u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\\u201d Well\\u2026 \\u201cHe blushed!\\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \\u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\\u201d \\u201cSo she wrapped her self up\\u201d \\u201cin a curtain cocoon.\\u201d \\u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\\u201d \\u201cShe smelled like shit!

[Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\\u2026 It\\u2019s really a story that\\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \\u201cThe squares lived happily.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square houses.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square yard.\\u201d \\u201cIn their square town.\\u201d \\u201cBut then one day,\\u201d \\u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\\u201d \\u201cGet out of here roundies!\\u201d \\u201cShouted one of the squares.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\\u201d \\u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cWhen I walk into a party\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\\u201d \\u201ccos everyone\\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\\u2019s here\\u201d \\u201cFinally we\\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\\u201d Like you wait\\u2026 in the game\\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \\u201cIf I had a million dollars\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\\u201d \\u201cafterwards I\\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \\u201cMid October,\\u201d \\u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\\u201d \\u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\\u201d \\u201cAnd me.\\u201d \\u201cEating that pussy baby!\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\\u2026 There\\u2019s things that I don\\u2019t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\\u2019t realize it\\u2019s an act up here. I don\\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\\u2019t be a dick. And I don\\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. My love\\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\\u2019t need it. I\\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \\u201cWalking between the micorphones\\u201d \\u201cis really awkward.\\u201d Tell me about it. Um\\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\\u2019m a guy. And I\\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \\u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\\u2019re the dumb ones. It\\u2019s time for a story. Let\\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cA very special story\\u201d \\u201cEspecially for you.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a story!\\u201d \\u201cSit down and listen now.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a Jew.\\u201d This story is called\\u2026 It\\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\\u2026 This story is called: \\u201cAndy the frog\\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\\u201d [Frog noise] \\u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\\u201d \\u201cin his entire frog life.\\u201d \\u201cHe had three best friends:\\u201d \\u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cSo one day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cOne day\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\\u201d \\u201con the other side of the pond.\\u201d \\u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cAcross the pond stood\\u201d \\u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\\u201d \\u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\\u201d \\u201cClassic Roger!\\u201d \\u201cAnd then she was gone.\\u201d \\u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\\u201d \\u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\\u201d \\u201cHe then came across a turtle.\\u201d \\u201cYou can\\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\\u201d \\u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\\u201d \\u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \\u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\\u201d \\u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \\u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\\u201d \\u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\\u201d \\u201chis patience ran thin.\\u201d \\u201cAndy kept moving.\\u201d [Laughter] \\u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\\u201d \\u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\\u201d \\u201cI woke up this morning,\\u201d \\u201cAnd I sat on a log.\\u201d \\u201cI opened up the menu,\\u201d \\u201cthe menu said FROG!\\u201d [Laughs] \\u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\\u201d \\u201cI can feel my self dying!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re ripping out my insides!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s no God, Is there?\\u201d \\u201cFuck!\\u201d \\u201cFUCK!!!!\\u201d The end. The end! So, that\\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\\u2019s such a man\\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\\u2019s a firefighter so\\u2026 He was fired\\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \\u201cThere\\u2019s a creepy old man\\u201d \\u201cfishing in a park.\\u201d \\u201cand the only problem is\\u201d \\u201che tied a candy bar\\u201d \\u201cto the end of his line.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\\u201d You know that stuff\\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\\u2026 They don\\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\\u2026 I\\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \\u201clook at me!\\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\\u2019ll say something random like like: \\u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\\u201d Or: \\u201cI\\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\\u201d Or: \\u201cAt first I wasn\\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\\u201d \\u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\\u2026\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\\u201d Or um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\\u2019t want to kill my self.\\u201d Or\\u2026 That\\u2019s\\u2026 too\\u2026 Too real. Or: \\u201cYo man! Life\\u2019s about three things man,\\u201d \\u201cThree things!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 money!\\u201d \\u201cGettin\\u2019 pussy!\\u201d \\u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\\u201d Or\\u2026 Um\\u2026 Or: \\u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\\u2026 If i could break\\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\\u2026 I\\u2019m so grateful that you\\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\\u2026 I\\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \\u201cLet us go then, you and I.\\u201d \\u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\\u201d \\u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\\u2026 capture how they\\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\\u2019t think that I\\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \\u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \\u201cOh no!\\u201d \\u201cSound the alarm!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not appealing\\u201d \\u201cto little girls\\u201d \\u201cwho don\\u2019t have arms.\\u201d But they can\\u2019t use iTunes, so\\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody!

[Gasps: \\u201cI love you\\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\\u2026 .rep\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026I am a vessel\\u2026 \\u2026.666\\u2026 [Garbled voice] \\u2026Illuminati\\u2026 We know it\\u2019s not right. We know it\\u2019s not funny. But we\\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\\u2026 Um\\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\\u2019s the end of \\u201cwhat.\\u201d I hope you liked it\\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Guy voice] But what you gotta do [Guy voice] in order to take your career [Guy voice] to the next level, [Guy voice] you gotta cater more heavily to them. [Guy voice] Alright, we\\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know.

So\\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\\u2019t know why I called it that. I\\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\\u2026 obviously.

And you go, \\u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\\u201d Yeah. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\\u2019re great at the jobs they\\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\\u2019re bred to do. They\\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \\u201cRight, dogs!\\u201d They go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\\u201d \\u201cWe all do. We all do.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, Labradors.\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\\u201d \\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\\u201d \\u201cJack Russells?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d -\\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah!\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d \\u201cFuckin\\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\\u201d -\\u201cMiniature poodles?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah?\\u201d \\u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job.\\u201d That\\u2019s your job. \\u201cRidgebacks?\\u201d \\u201cYo!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re hunting lions.\\u201d \\u201cFuck off!\\u201d -\\u201cYeah, you are.\\u201d -\\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaking babies.\\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\\u2019s different, everyone\\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \\u201cI was offended.\\u201d -\\u201cWhy?\\u201d -\\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\\u201d \\u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\\u201d That\\u2019s the thing about offense, it\\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\\u2019t care about the backlash. \\u201cComedian in hot water.\\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \\u201cWhat have you said?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry. They won\\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \\u2019em.\\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \\u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \\u201cI got a good intro.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it. She said, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t do that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \\u201cIs this too much?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it! I would never\\u2026 I\\u2019d never\\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\\u2019d never even\\u2026 think\\u2026 of that, so don\\u2019t\\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll start\\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\\u201d She went, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\\u201d Jane went, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCancer.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t do it, so\\u2026 you\\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\\u2019t exist, so\\u2026 I\\u2019d never say that in public, so\\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \\u201cIt was transphobic.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\\u2019s live, so they go, \\u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\\u201d They\\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \\u201cRelax, I\\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\\u201d And I go,\\u00a0\\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\\u201d And what a year she\\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\\u2026\\u201d That\\u2019s a clever joke. I\\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\\u2019s\\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\\u2026 one of the press said, \\u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\\u201d She went, \\u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\\u2026 I just sent back, \\u201cLet her host. Just don\\u2019t let her drive.\\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \\u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\\u201d I just sent back: \\u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \\u201cWhy is it transphobic?\\u201d They said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s about a trans person.\\u201d That\\u2019s ridiculous. That\\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\\u2026 famous\\u2026 man. With a huge\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\\u2019s wrong. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\\u2026 man\\u2026 Years ago, I\\u2019m saying. And she went to the\\u2026 doctor\\u2026 and\\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d This is years ago. I\\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\\u2026 a flashback before anyone\\u2026 You know what\\u2026 so\\u2026 so, like, \\u201cCome in!\\u201d And he went, \\u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Because that\\u2026 that was his name\\u2026 then. The doctor\\u2013 This was years ago\\u2026 The doctor went, \\u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner\\u2013 That was\\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 \\u201cLook at that.\\u201d The doctor went, \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\\u2026 \\u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not my pole, that\\u2019s my enormous penis.\\u201d \\u201cWell, seeing as it\\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\\u2026 That was his name for\\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\\u2019re my enormous testicles.\\u201d That\\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \\u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\\u2013 I\\u2019m a medical man. You\\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\\u2019re a big\\u2026 You\\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\\u2026 cock and\\u2026 balls. They\\u2019re beautiful.\\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \\u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\\u201d Bruce went, \\u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\\u201d And the doctor went, \\u201cWhat? Why?\\u201d \\u201cOh, they get in the way.\\u201d \\u201cIn the way of what?\\u201d \\u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\\u201d So, I\\u2019m engaging these people, and I\\u2019m saying, \\u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\\u2019s the joke. I say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\\u201d Then I do the joke.\\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\\u2019t changed. She\\u2019s always identified\\u00a0as a woman. That means she\\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\\u2019re a woman, you are. I\\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\\u2026 Don\\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\\u2019m halfway there. I\\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\\u2026 So\\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\\u2019m a chimp. I\\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\\u2019d be lovely. I\\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\\u2026 You know. I reckon that\\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\\u2013 I\\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\\u2019d rather have done. I\\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\\u2026 to a chimp. So\\u2026 So, I\\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\\u2019d do all that, all the\\u2026 I\\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\\u2019m talking to Jane, she\\u2019s going, \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\\u201d \\u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\\u2019s a fire!\\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\\u2019d\\u2026 revert. She\\u2019d be over that fucking\\u2026 Easy. So I\\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\\u2019ll be well\\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\\u2019s hand. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d Right? We don\\u2019t hold hands now. I don\\u2019t know why she\\u2019s all over me now I\\u2019m a chimp. But we\\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \\u201cCome on, Bobo.\\u201d In love. Just two\\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fucking disgusting.\\u201d I\\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\\u2019s why that joke isn\\u2019t transphobic. So\\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\\u2026 our parents mate\\u2026 we\\u2019re born\\u2026 we grow\\u2026 we mate\\u2026 our parents die\\u2026 our friends die\\u2026 and then we die. Now\\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re seven. You know\\u2026 today. So\\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\\u2019s cancelled, so\\u2026\\u201d Let\\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \\u201cI\\u2019m proper pregnant.\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \\u201cMum!\\u201d It\\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\\u2019re\\u2026 we\\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\\u2019re covered in shit, there\\u2019s screaming. You go, \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d Someone goes, \\u201cYes, you fucking can!\\u201d The first one second of life\\u00a0on Earth. You don\\u2019t know where you are. You can\\u2019t choose where you\\u2019re born. I was\\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\\u2019t have chosen that. I\\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\\u2019s a rarefied place. It\\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\\u2019t many pedophiles\\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \\u201cbender\\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \\u201cHe\\u2019s out of touch. He\\u2019s so famous. He\\u2019s rich. He\\u2019s mega-rich.\\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \\u201cHe\\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\\u2026 scum.\\u201d And I say.. I say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t call them scum, right?\\u201d But even the papers, they try and\\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\\u2019ll always say, \\u201cDo you always fly first class?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. Often private.\\u201d Right? The number of times I\\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \\u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\\u2019t know, but that\\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But here\\u2019s\\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have children.\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you have children?\\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \\u201cWhy do you have children?\\u201d Let\\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\\u2019t exist on any level? There\\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \\u201cWe want to be born!\\u201d Right? But I\\u2019ve thought about it and there\\u2019s three reasons I don\\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\\u2019s millions! The world\\u2019s over-populated. No-one\\u2019s going, \\u201cRick\\u2019s not having kids. We\\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\\u2019s all \\u201cme, me, me\\u201d, isn\\u2019t it? \\u201cFeed me.\\u201d \\u201cClothe me.\\u201d \\u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\\u201d No\\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\\u2019t want to pay you back. They\\u2019re not grateful. They don\\u2019t go, \\u201cThanks for having me.\\u201d It\\u2019s \\u201cI didn\\u2019t wanna be born.\\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll never see that money back. They\\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\\u2019t he? So\\u2026 He\\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\\u201d Yes, I know. \\u201cThese are my cunty friends.\\u201d I know, it\\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\\u2026 First, he\\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little\\u2026\\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\\u2019d know he\\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\\u2019d say, \\u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\\u2019d go, \\u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\\u2019s why you\\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\\u2026 I\\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\u00a0I\\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\\u2019t let the bedbugs\\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \\u201cJane?\\u201d -\\u201cWhat?\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d -\\u201cI\\u2019m in the shower.\\u201d -\\u201cCome here.\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cFucking dead already. I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 Just fucking\\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\\u2026\\u201d If Jane was out, I\\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\\u2019t I? What could you\\u2026 \\u201cBaby\\u2019s dead.\\u201d She\\u2019d come back. \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cYep\\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d -\\u201cWhat happened here, then?\\u201d I go, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fucking idiot.\\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\\u2019t he? He\\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village weren\\u2019t so lucky. They didn\\u2019t\\u2026 They didn\\u2019t make it out. Right? I\\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\\u2019d go, \\u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\\u2019re not in Africa now. That\\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\\u2019s not free. It\\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\\u2026 Yeah, course it\\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\\u201d No, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\\u201d -\\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I bet you do.\\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\\u2019re about\\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\\u2026 \\u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\\u2019s fine. He\\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \\u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cDoes it look like mine?\\u201d I\\u2019d go\\u2026 \\u201cThis is Hampstead. It\\u2019s obviously broken in.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\\u2019t mean my own family. They\\u2019ve given up. I\\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\\u2019s about 50. I don\\u2019t know\\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\\u2019s all \\u201cUncle Ricky!\\u201d They know I\\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \\u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\\u201d Then they hover. -\\u201cBusy?\\u201d -I go, \\u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\\u201d They go, \\u201cWorking the weekend?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNot filming, but I\\u2019ll be in the edit.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\\u201d \\u201cAh. Great. Great.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, she\\u2019s eight.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a photograph.\\u201d I go, \\u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \\u201cShe\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s gotta be long.\\u00a0Too short, it\\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \\u201cYeah, right.\\u201d Too long and it\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 She\\u2019s fucking beautiful.\\u201d It\\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\\u2026 I\\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\\u2019s a difference. I didn\\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\\u2019t take much. I\\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\\u2019re horrified. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s looking.\\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s that bloke? I\\u2019m not queueing!\\u201d It\\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\\u2019ve got a place there, but I\\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\\u2026 It\\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\\u2019s on. She\\u2019ll love that. She\\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \\u201cJane, get up here with me.\\u201d Right? Front two seats\\u2026 They board us early. We\\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\\u2019s like\\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That\\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll try it.\\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\\u2019s dead. You go, \\u201cFucking hell, that\\u2019s amazing, that is!\\u201d And they always use that voice, don\\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \\u201cNothing bad will happen.\\u201d They\\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\\u2019m using this voice, don\\u2019t worry. Things like, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013\\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \\u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\\u2019re hoping they\\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\\u2019re going, \\u201cGod, I\\u2019m\\u00a0gonna die, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m doing!\\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\\u2019t. But\\u2026 They\\u2019re fucking loud. It\\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\\u2019s brilliant. Right\\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \\u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\\u201d She goes off. I go, \\u201cHave you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\\u201d She went, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\\u2019s getting on who\\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\\u201d I went, \\u201cOh, my god, of course.\\u201d I was fuming. I mean\\u2026 What\\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\\u2026 fucking\\u2026 this woman will\\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\\u2026 if being\\u2026 just near a nut\\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \\u201cOh, I wish I\\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\\u2019t work. She\\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\\u2026 And\\u2026 die. And someone would go, \\u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\\u201d You know, right? So I don\\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\\u2026 in nuts\\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \\u201cCan I have any nuts?\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, not a problem.\\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\\u2026 I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d I touch her all over. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cNuts!\\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \\u201cWho\\u2019s been eating nuts?\\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \\u201coutrage\\u201d, I mean one person going, \\u201cHow dare you?\\u201d This woman goes, \\u201cI saw you on\\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWho is this woman?\\u201d She\\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\\u201d You know when you\\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \\u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\\u201d And cause the teacher\\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\\u2026 She said\\u2026 \\u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \\u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\\u2026 \\u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \\u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\\u201d She sent back, \\u201cYes,\\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\\u2019t kill children.\\u201d Well\\u2026 it did, didn\\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t kill children\\u2026\\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\\u2026 I know who\\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\\u2019s enjoying it. \\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d \\u201cJa, ist\\u00a0yummy!\\u201d Right? He\\u2019s loving it. I go, \\u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\\u201d She\\u2019s going, \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat that.\\u201d Fucking hell. \\u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\\u201d \\u201cMe!\\u201d \\u201cAll right. Here!\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t eat them.\\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat\\u2019s what the world\\u2019s like. People see something they don\\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\\u2019m not saying this because I\\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \\u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\\u2019s better when you\\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\\u2019s happening, being old is\\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \\u201cOh fuck, I didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \\u2019cause I\\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\\u2026 And\\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \\u201cI\\u2019m having a heart attack.\\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\\u2019s just fucked. It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 it\\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \\u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. 48.\\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\\u2019t give anything up. I don\\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\\u2019t\\u2026\\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\\u2019t do enough. Cause I\\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\\u2019m losing my hair. It\\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\\u2019ve got away with it\\u2026 you haven\\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a wig in here.\\u201d -I go. \\u201cIs there?\\u201d -\\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\\u2026 \\u201cElvis! What is\\u2013\\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d She went, \\u201cIt was a miracle.\\u201d They were lying! They were just\\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\\u2019re going, \\u201cYeah, it just grew back.\\u201d There\\u2019s so much he wouldn\\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \\u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\\u201d He wasn\\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\\u2019s holding a baby, it\\u2019s always at arms\\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\\u2026 cancer\\u2026 How\\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \\u201cNot a problem.\\u201d We\\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\\u2019re ready, because you\\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\\u2019t talk about, so you\\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\\u2026 I only found out recently, I\\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\\u2019t checking them or anything\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t see \\u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\\u2019ve been getting older, and they\\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\\u2026 as I\\u2019ve got older, I\\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\\u2026 In the sea, you\\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \\u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \\u201cHold on, this bath\\u2019s two feet deep!\\u201d Right? I\\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\\u2019re on top. What\\u2019s going on? Right? And\\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\\u2019m just thinking, \\u201cThis is bizarre.\\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\\u2026 I thought, \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s a fluke.\\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\\u2019re really\\u2026 They\\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \\u201clike me\\u201d, \\u201cagree with me\\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \\u201cI don\\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \\u201cWho\\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\\u2019re not on our side.\\u201d It\\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \\u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\\u201d \\u201cI believe you\\u2019re a fucking idiot.\\u201d You can\\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \\u201cLet\\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\\u201d Let\\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \\u201cDo not drink\\u201d. Right? Let\\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \\u201cTweet us your news.\\u201d Don\\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\\u2019t happen again.\\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \\u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \\u201cI already pay \\u00a3960 a year, so I\\u2019m not happy.\\u201d The next one said, \\u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\\u2019s not good enough.\\u201d The last one said, \\u201cI say it\\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\\u2019s fine not to.\\u201d That\\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\\u2019d tweet things like \\u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\\u201d Someone would always go, \\u201cWe know what you\\u2019re fucking doing.\\u201d This is a tweet I got\\u00a0after one of those. And\\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\\u2026 That\\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\\u2019s\\u2026 Remember it\\u2019s in capitals. He\\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \\u201cYOUR SCIENCE\\u2013\\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\\u2019t it? I mean\\u2026 He\\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\\u2019s\\u2026 \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU\\u2026 Well, it will. It\\u2019s helping him\\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\\u2026\\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\\u2019re not gonna say to him, \\u201cDo you believe in Satan?\\u201d And have him say, \\u201cBit far-fetched.\\u201d Why doesn\\u2019t God kill Satan? That\\u2019s\\u2026 what I\\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\\u2019d go, \\u201cOh, you do exist.\\u201d He\\u2019d go, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \\u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\\u2019d say, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan?\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\\u2026 I mean, you do want\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cYes, yeah.\\u201d \\u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\\u201d \\u201cYeah.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you kill him, then?\\u201d \\u201cBecause\\u2026 Shut up.\\u201d \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\\u201d And he\\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\\u2019ve ever received. \\u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\\u201d So\\u2026 he\\u2019s there too! He\\u2019s\\u2026 So, he\\u2019s a fundamentalist\\u2026 Christian, who\\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\\u2026 \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \\u201cHa, ha, ha!\\u201d He\\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\\u2019s not next, right? So I\\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\\u2019s just there. \\u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like that. \\u201cYeah, whatever.\\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\\u201d Like that. I might say, \\u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\\u201d And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cWhy are they so distended?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cOh, like you\\u2019re Brad Pitt!\\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\\u2026 \\u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\\u201d He\\u2019s probably bored. \\u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \\u201cSatan?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And I go, \\u201cYeah? What?\\u201d He goes, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\\u201d \\u201cFuck this!\\u201d He\\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \\u201cAh, loser!\\u201d And he\\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \\u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\\u2019s still all going off, right? It\\u2019s really funny, I\\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\\u2019m scrolling down. There\\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d No! No! What? No\\u2026 \\u201cYour mates find rape funny?\\u201d No! Listen, right? \\u201cYou find rape funny?\\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\\u2026 I said to her, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t tweet that.\\u201d -She went, \\u201cYou retweeted it.\\u201d -To show he\\u2019s an idiot. \\u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, well, it\\u2019s up to him, isn\\u2019t it? He can do it.\\u201d Now I\\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\\u2019m fighting for his right\\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\\u2019m so conscious of \\u201cfreedom of speech\\u201d\\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \\u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\\u201d That\\u2019s never\\u2026 So\\u2026 I sent back, \\u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\\u201d She said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d -I went, \\u201cDepends on the joke.\\u201d \\u201c-It fucking doesn\\u2019t!\\u201d I\\u2019m going, \\u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\\u2019s about context,\\u00a0it\\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\\u201d She said, \\u201cEven a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been a rape up there!\\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\\u2019s so narcissistic, he\\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\u00a0\\u201cSome jokes don\\u2019t punch up or down. They don\\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\u00a0on words, that don\\u2019t really mean anything.\\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \\u201cHelp, I\\u2019ve been graped!\\u201d The policeman says, \\u201cDo you mean raped?\\u201d She says, \\u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\\u2026. And I even said to her, \\u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \\u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\\u2026 still\\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \\u2018rape\\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \\u201cWhat a weird door policy.\\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \\u201cCan I just ask you a question?\\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\\u2019t laugh if you\\u2019re in. Off you go. That\\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\\u2019m just tweeting. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s following me. I\\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \\u201cGuitar lessons\\u201d, and you go, \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\\u201d What\\u2019s this? There\\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter\\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\\u2019s or something. That\\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \\u201cBan bullfighting.\\u201d Someone always says, \\u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\\u201d What? Well, I\\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\\u2019m not saying, \\u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\\u2019s a bull here!\\u201d And there\\u2019s one thing that I didn\\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\\u2019t really read it. It\\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \\u201cRacist!\\u201d I go, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d They go, \\u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\\u201d Yep, we do. I don\\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\\u2019s not about the species. It\\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \\u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\\u2019s screaming, they\\u2019re laughing. It\\u2019s the worst thing I\\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to tweet that.\\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \\u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \\u201cIs that language necessary?\\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\\u201d She said, \\u201cI just hate the C-word.\\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \\u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\\u201d Thank you! You\\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\\u2019s not the point. I\\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \\u201cHe\\u2019s healing them.\\u201d That\\u2019s what comedy\\u2019s for, what humor\\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\\u2019d won the argument. And he\\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \\u201cIf it looked\\u00a0respectable, we\\u2019d be respectable.\\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \\u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\\u201d And she\\u2019d take it, she\\u2019d go in, and she\\u2019d be horrified. She\\u2019d call Bob. \\u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\\u201d Even at her funeral\\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\\u2019d never been to church, he didn\\u2019t know us, we didn\\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \\u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \\u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\\u201d The vicar went, \\u201cI can\\u2019t say that.\\u201d Bob said, \\u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\\u201d He was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\\u2013 Bob\\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\\u2019t warn us. We\\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\\u2019s going\\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\\u2026 All right. And the church is like\\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\\u2019d see Larry go\\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\\u2019s thinking, \\u201cWhat have I said?\\u201d Right? He\\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \\u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\\u201d And they\\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \\u201cSorry, was that okay?\\u201d Me and Bob went,\\u00a0\\u201cFucking brilliant,\\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I mean. We\\u2019re all\\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\\u2026 it might go badly. But you\\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\\u2026 So\\u2026 we\\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\\u2019s at the window. He said, \\u201cWhere are we off to?\\u201d Bob went, \\u201cBognor.\\u201d He went,\\u00a0\\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes.

              "[['[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even hav',\n",
              "  'e the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut',\n",
              "  ' off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that',\n",
              "  ' walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, ',\n",
              "  'no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna ha',\n",
              "  'ppen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little m',\n",
              "  'aniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was ',\n",
              "  'weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into ',\n",
              "  'a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once i',\n",
              "  'n a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

He’s 22 years old. He’s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He’s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You’re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you’re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE! Welcome to the show this is Bo, this is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this. Welcome to the show, this is Bo this is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this. Play an invisible drum. [Invisible drum sounds] Play an invisible trumpet. Trumpet sound! Drink some invisible water, OH SHIT! That water is real! Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Random voice Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a healthy dose of prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact.

Magic isn’t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn’t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn’t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn’t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo’s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It’s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you… What the fuck you… What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he’d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: “All right, for the last time man, I’m not a troll.” “I’m homeless.” “Okay? Do you have any spare change?” “Okay, that’s a used napkin.” “I don’t want that.” “No. No, stop. Just-” “You know, leave. Just leave. Please leave.” And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: “Hello, Bo!” ‘I’ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-” [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe. For now… But the dark thoughts would soon return. IT’S GODZILLA! AAAAHHHHH!!! AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [Screeching] OH MY GOD AHHHHH!!!! [Screeching] GODZILLA!! AAAAAUUUGGHHHHHH!!! [Screeching] It’s so hard to be a lizard. It’s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It’s hard to be a lizard. But it’s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here’s a hint. He’s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give ’em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It’s natu',\n",
              "  'rally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I’d like to, uh, I’d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don’t you hate it when you’re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I’ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We’re having fun… This, um- This show is called “what”. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It’s a good start. Uh, hope there’s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it… He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc– Just, don’t, if it’s on repeat it will repeat. Just… we can cut all this, so… We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art’s still a lie. Nothing’s still real! Food jokes. Let’s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um… [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn’t control my stools. Alright, Jesus… I’m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So… Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: “A world on fire” [Screaming] This next song, it’s a little bit… it’s a little bit longer then that one. And… Thank you. It’s about how sad I am, and I’m really sad, it’s called “Sad” [Piano music] It’s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn’t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn’t see it in the pouring rain. He didn’t hear me shout: “look out for the train!” Cos I didn’t say anything. I just thought to my self: “Ooh, this is going to be sad.” And it was. I’m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self, I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so fucking sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there’s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it’s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I’ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven’t been sad at all, you’ve been… You’ve been happy. No… You’ve been laughing. That’s it, laughter. That’s the key to everything. It’s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn’t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It’s being a hero. The world isn’t sad, the world is funny. I’m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holo',\n",
              "  'caust and 9/11, that shit’s funny 24/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I’ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking… I think we should do a poem right now, if that’s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we’ll get it out of the way now, and we’ll go back to the… Oops… the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It’s called: “I fuck sluts” [audience member yells] It’s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They’ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that’ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I’ve missed. I’ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um… The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don’t trust there sluts, Don’t, don’t you dare. They’ll force you to trust them and love them and care. And then they’ll be gone and you’ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm… [laughter] This’s for you: Here’s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it’s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like “shucks” as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also “shucks” the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We’re having fun. Umm… My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: “really dad?” “Prove it!” [laughter] He sad: “Well what about that joke” “where you throw confetti at the end of it?” I said: “well I haven’t written that joke yet,” “cos it’s based of this conversation!” “Gotcha!” Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don’t worry, you don’t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don’t want you leaving this show thinking: “My hands hurt from clapping.” “My stomach hurts from laughing.” I just want you leaving the show, thinking: “Meh… alright…” And we are on our way. I moved to, um… Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and… [audience member yells] Places! And I… [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It’s called: “What did I do last night?” [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sl',\n",
              "  'eep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old… I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: “Do you know how your father and I love each other” I said: “Of course.” “You and dad love each other” “more then two people could possible love each other.” She said: “Well two men can love each other in the exact same way” “that your father and I love each other.” She said: “what happens when two men love each other like that.” “What they do is, they take off all their clothes” “Umm.. they get into bed” “And they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!” [laughter] So I don’t talk to her anymore. OK [80’s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I’m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working? No, it hasn’t been. [Robotic voice] What are your remaining symptoms? I just… I internalise my feelings. I have trouble articulati… Like, other people, and relating to them… [Robotic voice] So basically you’re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice. [Robotic voice] I was just joking n i g g e r. [laughter] We are right by Oakland, careful with that shit. [Robotic voice] I’m not human, I can say whatever I want. Alright, Just get to the… What, what’s wrong with me, please. [Robotic voice] Your emotions and your logic are at war. OK. [Robotic voice] Your creativity and your analysis are at war. [Robotic voice] And most simply [Robotic voice] Your left and your right brain are at war. My left and my right… ? [Robotic voice] To fix the problem [Robotic voice] We must separate them from each other. Separa… [Robotic voice] Splitting your neurological functions in: [5] [4] [3] We book an appointment. [2 … 1] You don’t just start counting down. [Robotic voice] This may hurt a bit I don’t even know what “it” is. [Robotic voice] Zero. Just… [high pitched robotic sounds] [Robotic voice] Isolation complete. [Robotic voice] This is Bo’s left brain. [Robotic voice] Objective. Logical. Cold. [Robotic voice] Analytical. Aware of patterns. [Robotic voice] Aware of trends. [Robotic voice] He’s efficient. [Robotic voice] And a prick. [Robotic voice] This is Bo’s right brain. [Robotic voice] Subjective. Creative. Sensory. [Robotic voice] Aware of feelings. [Robotic voice] Aware of people. [Robotic voice] He’s emotional. Yes. [Robotic voice] And an idiot. That’s your opinion… So just… Be careful with opinions… Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You’ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I’m a little all over the place, but I’m lustful, trustful, and I’m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she’s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There’s something about her, I just can’t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit… sit… Alright new right brain, you’re being insane. No left brain! I’m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I’m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don’t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you’re happy. Cos he',\n",
              "  '’s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We’re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You’re a quivering pussy. I’m the pussy? Well at least I don’t play with toys still. OK, Rubik’s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking… toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he’s feeling. How he’s feeling? If he’s feeling unhappy, it’s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I’m sorry. No you’re not… Look, maybe there’s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I’m listening… It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I’ll man the form. It’s something that George Carlin did, It’s something that Steve Martin did, It’s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I’ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain… Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I’d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I’m pretty fucking deep… deep… deep… So deep… That I called this song… Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren’t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that’s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I’m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they’re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh… That’s why you’re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell… You don’t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don’t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That’s called: “Beating off in A minor”. Yes… Yes… “A-minor”, the key, not the felony. So… I believe… [laughs] I believe there’s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It’s true. It’s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I’d like to do… erm… do some poems right now. Erm… if that’s OK? We’re at this point at the show. These poems are actually… I’m releasing this special for free so I’m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called “Egghead”. That will be out by the time thi',\n",
              "  's is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it’s all just sort of… This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we’ll go back to the giggles. So… This is a poem by a dog: “Roses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.” “Let’s go chase cars.” [Applause] + [Chimes] “Me. With my strange choice of adjectives.” “You with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.” [Chimes] “I put a chameleon on a red dildo.” Well… “He blushed!” There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. “Martha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.” “So she wrapped her self up” “in a curtain cocoon.” “And after a week she finally emerged.” “She smelled like shit! What a psycho.” [Chimes] + [Laughter] “You’re incomparable.” “Like a … ” [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] “I want to beat you to death with a blunt object!” “I want to grab one of those” “high end fashion manikins by the ankles” “and bash your rib cage in!” “I want to sharpen 15 pencils” “bind them with a rubber band” “stick the lead in your mouth” “and punch the erasers!” “I want to strap you to a bed of nails” “then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car” “so I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps” “in a mall parking lot during an earthquake!” “I want you to somehow survive” “a terrible car crash and then somehow” “not survive a small fender bender” “on the way back from a hospital.” [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that’s called “Dad”. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem… It’s really a story that’s meant primarily for children. But I think it’s got a lesson we could all learn. “The squares lived happily.” “In their square houses.” “In their square yard.” “In their square town.” “But then one day,” “a family of circles moved in from the west” “Get out of here roundies!” “Shouted one of the squares.” “Why? Said one of the circles” “Cos this is a metaphor for racism” [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] “When I walk into a party” “you’d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces” “cos everyone’s just like: Oh yeah. This guy’s here” “Finally we’ve been waiting for him to show up” Like you wait… in the game… Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. “If I had a million dollars” “I’d pay your mother to have sex with me” “afterwards I’d probably invest the remaining $999.990” Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: “Mid October,” “with leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.” “The streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.” “And me.” “Eating that pussy baby!” [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um… There’s things that I don’t want to come across in my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don’t realize it’s an act up here. I don’t want you to ever think that I think that I’m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um… anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn’t be a dick. And I don’t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don’t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You’re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I’d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There’s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn’t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn’t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don’t fucking rape people. Didn’t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don’t think masturbation is obscene. It’s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I’ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I',\n",
              "  ' send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You’re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You’re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn’t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I’m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn’t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love’s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won’t need it. My love’s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won’t need it. I’m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] “Walking between the micorphones” “is really awkward.” Tell me about it. Um… Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I’m a guy. And I’m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? “Why are you wearing a condom?” “I’m fucking you with a strap-on.” To be safe bitch! Women right, they’re the dumb ones. It’s time for a story. Let’s do a story. [Happy music] “It’s time for a story.” “It’s time for a story.” “A very special story” “Especially for you.” “It’s time for a story.” “It’s time for a story!” “Sit down and listen now.” “Don’t be a Jew.” This story is called… It’s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story… This story is called: “Andy the frog”. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I’ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it’s old, head. So here we go: “Once upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.” [Frog noise] “Andy lived at the patent park pond.” “And he never hopped anywhere else” “in his entire frog life.” “He had three best friends:” “Milly, who never left her lily pad.” [Laughs] “Billy, who was always hopping mad.” “And Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.” [Laughter] “So one day…” “One day…” “Andy saw something hop across the grass” “on the other side of the pond.” “Milly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.” “Across the pond stood” “The most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.” “She’s gorgeous! -Said Milly.” “She’s beautiful! -Said Billy.” “A bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.” “Classic Roger!” “And then she was gone.” “I need to go find her! -Said Andy.” “I need to follow my little frog heart.” “So Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.” “He then came across a turtle.” “You can’t pass! -Said the turtle.” “Please? -Said Andy.” “No! -Said the turtle.” And this is the first long convoluted simile: “Then there was a rustling in the bushes.” “And, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,” “the turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.” [Laughter] + [Applause] “Andy kept moving, but at this point,” “like the doctor of the Kenyan track team” “his patience ran thin.” “Andy kept moving.” [Laughter] “He then came across a giant crocodile.” “And the crocodile began to chant:” “I woke up this morning,” “And I sat on a log.” “I opened up the menu,” “the menu said FROG!” [Laughs] “Andy said: No! No! Please let go of me!” “I can feel my self dying!” “You’re ripping out my insides!” “I’m never going to find her, am i?” “There’s no God, Is there?” “Fuck!” “FUCK!!!!” The end. The end! So, that’s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are huma',\n",
              "  'ns. Why would it apply to us? Um… You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he’s such a man’s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he’s a firefighter so… He was fired… That was as stupid as we get. But let’s get a little stupider, ha? “There’s a creepy old man” “fishing in a park.” “and the only problem is” “he tied a candy bar” “to the end of his line.” “He’s trying to catch a kid.” You know that stuff… Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um… People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say… They don’t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be… They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I’m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan’s backgammon game. Is, I will… I’ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that… when I say it, I feel like: “look at me!” Participating in this new moment that no one’s ever been a part of. So I’ll say something random like like: “Peanut-butter tribadism.” Or: “I’m your father and I loved your comedy show.” Or: “At first I wasn’t comfortable leaving him alone with my children” “but then I saw his mustache. Phew…” Or um… Or: “Yo! Check out this Amish website!” Or um… Or: “I work at a toll booth and I don’t want to kill my self.” Or… That’s… too… Too real. Or: “Yo man! Life’s about three things man,” “Three things!” “Gettin’ money!” “Gettin’ pussy!” “And the Dewey Decimal System!” Or… Um… Or: “Hey! Can you hold my fanny pack I’m gonna go fuck a woman.” [Laughter] + [Applause] Um… If i could break… I want to tank you all for being here because I… I’m so grateful that you’d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely… I… This is my favorite thing to do. And I’m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um… OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: “Let us go then, you and I.” “When the evening is spread out against the sky” “like a patient etherised upon a table” -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they’ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they’ve changed it a bit. And I try to… capture how they’ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you’re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I’ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you’ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don’t think that I’m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on pub',\n",
              "  'erty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don’t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin’ We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. …repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song’s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you’re my agent, you might be thinking: “Oh no!” “Sound the alarm!” “You’re not appealing” “to little girls” “who don’t have arms.” But they can’t use iTunes, so… FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho… Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. Everybody!

And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: “I love you”] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff… .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff… .rep… [Garbled voice] …I am a vessel… ….666… [Garbled voice] …Illuminati… We know it’s not right. We know it’s not funny. But we’ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then… We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been… Um… you guys have been absolutely amazing. You’ve been absolutely amazing. That’s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that’s the end of “what.” I hope you liked it… [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god! [Girl voice] How are you?

An arrogant fucking prick!

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen. I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!” This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare. That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. I’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me w',\n",
              "  'as black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones. It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots. Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off. I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s v',\n",
              "  'ery good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear. Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited. I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars. And then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…” And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactiv',\n",
              "  'e rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.” He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them. I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out. The second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that. Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No',\n",
              "  ' Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect. We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated. And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit. You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in. Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.” They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal b',\n",
              "  'ox growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening? Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.” The third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.” Well, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to ',\n",
              "  'strike. I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us. My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.” And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for ',\n",
              "  'the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too. The ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure. Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works. Can’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to you',\n",
              "  'rself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough. You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪” And his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪” You know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money. Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to m',\n",
              "  'ake a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that.

              " ['[Car horn honks] [Audience cheering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jim Jefferies! [Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being ',\n",
              "  'a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never',\n",
              "  ' fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laug',\n",
              "  'hs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles] I’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to com',\n",
              "  \"e through.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in \",\n",
              "  'a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.” Now… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.” So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and i',\n",
              "  'f people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to ',\n",
              "  'another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life. I think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and ',\n",
              "  'killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South Afric',\n",
              "  'an, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.

              " ['Intro\\nFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all. “The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom! “My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all ',\n",
              "  'seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!” “The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah. “Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just',\n",
              "  ' stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was. “Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywher',\n",
              "  'e, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.” “Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. “If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a mino',\n",
              "  'r, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go. “Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared. “Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.” “Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides',\n",
              "  ', Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.” “First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there. “Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a state',\n",
              "  'ly look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!” “Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye t',\n",
              "  'o these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad. “Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!” “Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it e',\n",
              "  'nding. “Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man. “If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave t',\n",
              "  'hem in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought. “Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.

              " ['Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, li',\n",
              "  'sten, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is ',\n",
              "  'equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “',\n",
              "  'me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not ',\n",
              "  'filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you f',\n",
              "  'ind so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ',\n",
              "  'ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal ',\n",
              "  'vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She ',\n",
              "  'said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, wit',\n",
              "  'h nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window.

makes sense you know the ten commandments dont kill anybody dont touch my wife thats my bike right that all makes sense of which ive broken i think ive broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one thats it i havent killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and theyre wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh shh shh right see the whole thing so well see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where were going and what happens after we die everybody elses religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles theres a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life  yeah like your guys name is ron ron and he wasnt alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like   years ago he had a drivers license social security number theres like footage of him stubbing his toe motherfucker right i know what happened he was working at dennys he got sick of it ill start a religion hey everybody theres this spaceship coming back everybodys getting sneakers this is tom cruise were gonna try to make you clear right look im paraphrasing im paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but thats essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesnt you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we\\u2013 right we got the space shuttle you know theres sneakers theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right ah son there is no fat fuck its your mother and i your moms the tooth fairy rabbits dont have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams wont come true right and i was just like wow this is how the world is and meanwhile this shit was just floating this  gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i dont go anymore or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think hes along for the ride the two of them theyre a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going this dude just stops thats what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didnt read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated away  so now its like im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  id like to believe in something so ive been going around asking people what their shit is and i havent been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there theyre like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die youre dead and thats it dead like a pigeon just\\u2013 just layin there over blew my mind im like really youre just dead like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life well i dont know about this right here mind explaining yourself this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that im gonna get judged someday like if thats true that somebodys gonna judge me that doesnt even make any sense its like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right lets not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you dont think this things gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didnt run i wouldnt burn it forever you evil piece of shit just light it on fire i wouldnt i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you im gonna try and help you out yes my religion its nuts its fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldnt or some of your friends doesnt even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if thats the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up jesus christ where the hell are they its been like  years they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right and then one day it just settles in that they didnt make it and then what im still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over hey how is it going everybody isnt this great isnt this great yeah dude itd be even better if all my family members and friends werent burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didnt ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals hey hey how is it going over here why did you come over here i dont give a damn dude tell your dad i dont give a fuck im already in here im already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the bosss son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement so yeah so they believe when you die youre dead and i was like so youre just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldnt get my head around it he goes well like before when you were born do you remember that and i was like no and the guys like yeah its just like that im like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared im getting as i get older im developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it its not straightacrosstheboard flying i dont like small planes all of a sudden i just dont like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just dont believe in the pilots cause you know what i dont think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like all right well give you like  people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another  back well let you do this for a while you do this for a while we dont get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit well move you up to  people and then one day youll be in a jet\\u2013 whoo were going a little faster right big planes youre getting the fuckin pilot that knows what hes doing hes probably fought in a war hes used to getting shot at he cant bring this bus in its a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back my headphones dont work he doesnt give a fuck right hes up there sleeping hes trying to make something happen hes so goddamn bored thats a stud up there right so one time im flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so im on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the planes made of like all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa im not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a  mustachioed male going whoo whaaa whoa dude the hair was standing up on my arms im praying to a higher power i dont even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit jesus christ you know you think im not up here thinking whaaa whoa i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we do  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now its all car stuff looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didnt fit what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit dads gonna be mad  theres never enough time to build the car its so fucking stupid we got to have this bus done by thursday or else what the guy doesnt want it anymore all right youll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch so before  before there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it theyre like all right stay away from that one stay away from that one hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love well hes nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that youre rolling the dice youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and youre gonna turn around all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i dont know man thats risky you know in reality im being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am cause i was just as scared as he was except i didnt scream out like he did and thats simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going how was your day whats wrong and all of that shit you know thats why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that youre a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock em down right come on it didnt hurt get up i didnt come from a family i dont know about you guys i didnt come from a touchyfeely call me when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head ill just be driving down the street just be like aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head theres something about me like all my regret comes up when im in the shower i dont know what it is i think cause im in the shower and i have time to think and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and ill just be in the shower just being like  and my wifes always just like is everything okay in there ill just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much every day so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didnt do that stuff she was like i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay and i was like you were afraid and she goes well it was your father thats what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them thats whats gonna happen so in a marriage theres compromises yeah so she basically never hugged us cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle\\u2013 sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i dont have any kids as far as id think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like dont change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler so he took it from that and knocked it down to dont hug him its gonna make him gay right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid ill whittle it down to like hes not taking drama class all right hes not taking drama class cause i said so lady let me handle this i wont fix everything and thats not a homophobic thing either that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isnt i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybodys like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here i dont want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married thats the big thing yes i did very happy about that im very happy because it was starting to get weird its like  years old my girlfriend yeah were gonna go out and get some pop going to parties it was just weird cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis its just its an advanced learning program the deadline is may  we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old id just be like did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didnt know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands so now im married so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but im  years old im just thinking its too fucking late ya know come on man im gonna have a kid im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee we used to use these on a saturday do a face plant my kids standing there mom dads sleeping again i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i dont understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit hey man its kind of cold out today dude you dont understand you dont understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right mine just turned six mine just turned seven i just feel hopelessly behind so what im actually thinking of doing im thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesnt have to be brandnew you know its like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right id love to adopt its a great thing to do but if i do it im not telling any of my friends im just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss em off mine just turned six mine just turned seven id love to just show up with an eightyearold like dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you dont understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam theyre just there like with all their issues i should do it though i should adopt i think its a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an   always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do id love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldnt that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing youre going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you youre coming home with me yeah dude how easy how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell hes been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home have a seat hell be like i get to sit down yeah lay down on the couch hell be like its like a cloud its like a cloud ill get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i dont know the kid would love me so thats my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round id probably get like an  boy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside thats how fucked up the world is theres little boys out there fighting in wars so thats a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of whats left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks im gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris standing next to me  kills confirmed fucking kills theyre not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you cant coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like id have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room im getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you youve been out of line all day mister dont even start that shit dont even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again ill break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude hes fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesnt he doesnt have to make his bed too no he doesnt because he doesnt sleep in the bed hes out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking me the fuck out all right oh fuck you fuck you he scares me too he scares me too dont even start that shit you wanted a big brother and i got you one dont even start that shit all right all right youre right stop crying stop crying shouldnt have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured hed chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you cant give him back it doesnt work that way there he is there he is whats up buddy whats going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right youre not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay so i figure uh i dont know if ill do it maybe im too selfish i have no idea im all over the fuckin map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do thats my latest thing you know why it is its cause i live in los angeles yeah and its an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning theres not even zoning laws theyll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then theres like a fucking daycare center right the city doesnt even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta youre all right i dont know maybe in atlanta might be crazy youre on the outskirts youre fine youre fine you dont live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath youre cool drink that water for a good  days la theres nowhere to go thats why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this im out vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street fuck this this looks safe you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter shes just like yeah no which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so there goes that hey what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask yeah im still gonna do it im just not gonna tell her im just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license im not going to tell her im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room shes just gonna be like what is that what is that for what does that mean yeah someday youll see someday youll see when the shit hits the fan and youre freaking the fuck out and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter what is that shut the fuck up and get in now you guys think im bullshitting im not im serious im  in on this and ever since i got into it im seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit theyre after me swear to god im seeing stories about them its just like that old advertising anecdote i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden theyre all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away its the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for  years\\u2013  years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream i built it up for  years here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad i love you all right this poor kid five days in hes supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but hes like i need the money i gotta give him a tour right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft thats orange county theres over  miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on  miles of beaches was established as a county in  sir please dont open the door sir what are you doing sir no no dont dont stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control i dont know whos on this frequency but you really need\\u2013 somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was  years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didnt go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man take me up in a chopper im looking at the land i love and then im jumping out like a superhero i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i cant imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like fuck you disease i decide ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer take me up in the chopper he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard hes not even listening to this guy giving the tour right over  miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in  sir please dont try to open the door no no dont dont dont   incredible but heres the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean  feet up youd think that would be enough so im thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic  belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didnt change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down hes got to be thinking three more seconds of pain two more seconds wham  oh my god this is worse this is way worse it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital thats right so heres to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but ive finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesnt want me to get one so yeah she didnt want\\u2013 dude you got to pick your fucking battles im gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i cant fucking have some  hanging around ill do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it cant be that person now it fucking bums me

bring the gun up point it at the car i pull the trigger i saw the muzzle flash i felt a kick i never heard the gun i pulled the trigger all i just heard was  i shot the gun four more times never heard

it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebodys head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i dont care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i dont give a fuck how tough you are i dont care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup thats a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night look im coming back im coming back ive been trying to get along with my wife better im trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship im not turning out the pilot light though all right im keeping some fight in me im not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like i guess were making holiday cookies that dude with the bowed shoulders she makes them and then im supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i dont even think they

hanging out and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted its fuckin unreal but what kills me is that theres actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them theyll be hey hows it been going its been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right no i dont i dont understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if youre dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to shes gonna come at you well lets get you in an arm bar all right all right all right tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch like  minutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch i fucking hate when she does this its like its not even fair have a debate like a normal person all right im gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone whos actually been sleeping on the couch okay so theres the first fear out the window okay she cant physically dominate you so thats gone whats the next fear shes gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized its the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her join me yeah ive never understood that threat thats like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now whats the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you cant handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad shes never bodyslammed me once ever im not saying to be a dick all right im just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback hey hey hey hey hey rest of the shit\\u2013 im learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everythings cool everythings cool just yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great im having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people im talking to people i am having a good time here thats what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something heres an olive branch ive extended to her its basically we fight a lot over television ive kind of come her way shes come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i dont care the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader ill watch it right i dont mind them its an uplifting story i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out theyre just so fucking nice its like missionarystyle theres candles that stupid saxophone music  it always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right cause they cant show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other  of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality thats never brought up that whole hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i dont even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didnt even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didnt know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like what are you doing she says like i dont know i just kinda like ya know its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why dont you want to do it itll be fun why dont i want to do it i dont think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up yeah shes in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while theyll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didnt know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god its the wall oh my god its supporting me maybe hell support me its a metaphor i love it yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall im like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife im like that is fucking bullshit bullshit what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all shes gonna do is this shes got to bring it up like an offsides call if thats what shes doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these muscles  maybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than  seconds before theyre like all right this is ridiculous okay my calves are burning i cant get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world these guys in the movie they have no problem banging away then they pick them up like theyre not heavy they start walking down they see the bed they just lay her down on the bed dude im not trying to be a dick but every woman in here is heavy yeah youre heavy youre an adult female jesus christ when do you stop picking up your kids when theyre like five or six get off of me jesus christ youre gonna throw out my back go jump on your brother an adult woman weighs  pounds  all the way up to god knows what and its not balanced weight most of its in your thighs and in your ass your heads hanging off trying to counterbalance dude when guys go to the gym we dont put  pounds on one side and a  over here fuckin yeah yeah its ridiculous trying to carry a naked woman its like trying to carry a halffilled waterbed mattress youre like bumping into shit when you see the bed you dont walk to it you slowly start picking up momentum then she bounces off this mattress hits the wall slides down the whole sex vibes ruined and youre back to your sandwich in your pocket all right im out of time you guys were awesome thank you so much thank you thank you i had

actually sad but for people like us that gotta fucking deal with them all the time being a comedian isnt being an insensitive prick capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public its being a hero the world isnt sad the world is funny im a sociopath i saw an old man slip and fall hey what a fucking idiot i saw a woman at her daughters funeral hahaha classic comedy everything that

experimentation complete thank you very much  at this part of the show id like to talk about how deep i am   im pretty fucking deep deep deep so deep that i called this song hashtag deep have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air me neither have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just werent there meat cleaver the people in my life are like grains of sand cos they stick together often near my butthole if life is an ocean i am a deep and handsome fish a fish thats drowning if the artistic process is a birth canal then i am a freshly jellied kid come witness my crowning these thoughts of mine must be a sign that im hashtag deep if jesus can walk on water can he swim on land have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face me neither me neither have you ever wrote a song note for note and not a single note was out of place  the people in my life are like blades of grass how cos theyre all so grounded but at least grass stays away from my butthole art is a harlot and i am her sassy urban friend oooh thats why youre being so selfish if mamma is right and the world is my oyster then i must have an allergy to shell you dont know how could you know if life makes you wish you were dead just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head spend forever asleep cos life pales in comparison to living the dream hashtag deep  thank you     dont you hate it when that happens yeah thank you thats called beating off in a minor yes yes aminor the key not the felony so i believe  i believe theres nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with  other guys its true its early caveman cromagnon wandering though the fog you know scrubbing  other sapiens no homo  id like to do erm do some poems right now erm if thats ok were at this point at the show these poems are actually im releasing this special for free so im going to plug my poetry book these are my new poems from my poetry book called egghead that will be out by the time this is airing but not by the time you guys are seated here right now they are pretty serious and its all just sort of this is usually the lull of the show usually so i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience and just read some poems and then well go back to the giggles so this is a poem by a dog roses are gray violets are a different shade of gray lets go chase cars    me with my strange choice of adjectives you with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina  i put a chameleon on a red dildo well he blushed there we go  this is a poem about beauty about self image and about the ability to transform martha was ugly like a shaven baboon so she wrapped her self up in a curtain cocoon and after a week she finally emerged she smelled like shit what a psycho    youre incomparable like a        i want to beat you to death with a blunt object i want to grab one of those high end fashion manikins by the ankles and bash your rib cage in i want to sharpen  pencils bind them with a rubber band stick the lead in your mouth and punch the erasers i want to strap you to a bed of nails then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car so i can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps in a mall parking lot during an earthquake i want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and then somehow not survive a small fender bender on the way back from a hospital    thank you thats called dad    this is a poem its really a story thats meant primarily for children but i think its got a lesson we could all learn the squares lived happily in their square houses in their square yard in their square town but then one day a family of circles moved in from the west get out of here roundies shouted one of the squares why said one of the circles cos this is a metaphor for racism      when i walk into a party youd think i was one of those long straight tetris pieces cos everyones just like oh yeah this guys here finally weve been waiting for him to show up like you wait in the game forget it  no you had your chance if i had a million dollars id pay your mother to have sex with me afterwards id probably invest the remaining  ten dollars for sex with your mother comedy i smell comedy well it was comedy giving off that scent and finally mid october with leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings the streets dicing our town into neat unfair portions and me eating that pussy baby    thank you so much um theres things that i dont want to come across in my show that i worry often come across about me cos people dont realize its an act up here i dont want you to ever think that i think that im better then people or that i think i know better then people um anyway sorry ok this is a song from the perspective of god      books you think i wrote are way to thick who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldnt be a dick and i dont watch you when you sleep surprisingly i dont use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep youre not going to heaven why the fuck would you think id ever kick it with you none of you are going to heaven theres a trillion aliens cooler then you you shouldnt abstain from rape just cos you think that i want you to you shouldnt rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do pretty obvious just dont fucking rape people didnt think i needed to write that one down for you i dont think masturbation is obscene its absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing ive ever seen you make my job a living hell i send gays to fix overpopulation boy did that go well youre not going to heaven eat a thousand crackers sing a million hymns none of you are going to heaven youre not my children you are a bad game of sim you shouldnt abstain from pork just cos you think that i want you to you can eat pork cos why the fuck would i give a shit i created the universe you think im drawing the line at the fucking deli isle    you argue and you bicker and you fight atheists and catholics jews and hindus argue day and night over what they think is true but no one entertains the thought that maybe god does not believe in you you pray so badly for heaven knowing any day might be the day that you die but maybe life on earth could be heaven doesnt just the thought of it make it worth a try my loves the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it you wont need it my loves the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it you wont need it im not gonna give you love just cos i know that you want me to if you want love then the love has gotta come from you     walking between the micorphones is really awkward tell me about it um women are stupid yeah i fucking said it they are the weaker dumber sex i can prove it to you i like to practice safe sex why cos im a guy and im smarter what do women say every time every time i put on a condom what do they say why are you wearing a condom im fucking you with a strapon to be safe bitch women right theyre the dumb ones its time for a story lets do a story  its time for a story its time for a story a very special story especially for you its time for a story its time for a story sit down and listen now dont be a jew this story is called its a glitch you can be jewish this story this story is called andy the frog featuring long and convoluted similes and ill warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears its old head so here we go once upon a time there was a frog name andy  andy lived at the patent park pond and he never hopped anywhere else in his entire frog life he had three best friends milly who never left her lily pad  billy who was always hopping mad and roger who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn  so one day one day andy saw something hop across the grass on the other side of the pond milly billy roger look said andy across the pond stood the most beautiful frog andy had ever seen shes gorgeous said milly shes beautiful said billy a bit old for my taste said roger classic roger and then she was gone i need to go find her said andy i need to follow my little frog heart so andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest he then came across a turtle you cant pass said the turtle please said andy no said the turtle and this is the first long convoluted simile then there was a rustling in the bushes and like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle the turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle    andy kept moving but at this point like the doctor of the kenyan track team his patience ran thin andy kept moving  he then came across a giant crocodile and the crocodile began to chant i woke up this morning and i sat on a log i opened up the menu the menu said frog  andy said no no please let go of me i can feel my self dying youre ripping out my insides im never going to find her am i theres no god is there fuck fuck the end the end so thats the end of that story    if you are curious the moral of that story is irrelevant cos we are humans why would it apply to us um you know my father is so hard to get along with cos hes such a mans man you know he believes like for example you should always fight fire with fire which is a horrible way to live your life especially for him because hes a firefighter so he was fired that was as stupid as we get but lets get a little stupider ha theres a creepy old man fishing in a park and the only problem is he tied a candy bar to the end of his line hes trying to catch a kid you know that stuff trying to get a little more mainstream  um people complain about the way i act on stage very often you know they say like i repeat jokes or they also say that they say they dont get again that this is an act on stage they think on stage i act too arrogant too selfobsessed solipsistic selfcontained synonyms and they want me to be they want me to be a comic of the people you know relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy so i want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys im like you guys you know once a week i like to slip into a deep existential depression where i loose all my sense of oneness and self worth haha and what i like to do in order to assure my self that i am unique and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in jesus and satans backgammon game is i will ill say a group a words that i think no one has ever said in that order so that when i say it i feel like look at me participating in this new moment that no ones ever been a part of so ill say something random like like peanutbutter tribadism or im your father and i loved your comedy show or at first i wasnt comfortable leaving him alone with my children but then i saw his mustache phew or um or yo check out this amish website or um or i work at a toll booth and i dont want to kill my self or thats too too real or yo man lifes about three things man three things gettin money gettin pussy and the dewey decimal system or um or hey can you hold my fanny pack im gonna go fuck a woman    um if i could break i want to tank you all for being here because i im so grateful that youd all come here and spend an hour of your time with me and if you are watching at home or whatever on a computer or something if you have made it this far that you very much for watching genuinely i this is my favorite thing to do and im so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it um ok i will now recede back into my stage persona   i just blacked out for  seconds thank you for coming love songs used to be so beautiful you know let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherised upon a table t s eliot beautiful love songs now a days just as beautiful guys usher justin bieber  you know them but these new artists theyve done something very strange to the format of the love song theyve changed it a bit and i try to capture how theyve changed the format of the love song with this love song i hope you enjoy it and mark the differences jason derulo i love your hair i love your name i love the way you say it i love your heart and youre so smart cos you gave away it i love your sis i love your dad and i love your mom but more then all of that i love the fact that you are dumb enough to not realise everything ive said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords but youll still love it and let me finger you yeaaa finger you finger you oh girl i hope you dont think that im rude when i tell you that i love you boo i also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel

new standup for seven years if you dont count the golden globes which you shouldnt the golden globes\\u00a0very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and its live big thrill but with that many people watching theres a bit of stick everyones different everyones a blogger everyone goes i was offended why he said an horrible thing he said loads of horrible things yeah but that was a thing that i care about thats the thing about offense its about personal feelings i dont care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things what have you said dont worry they wont come to the house fuck em so i wind her up i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before its in la we fly out im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson ill introduce him yes about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said i got a good intro she went what i said bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren i didnt do it she said you wont do that i said no next day i got her again i said is this too much i said not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy i didnt do it i would never id never tell a joke like that its horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane id never even think of that so dont even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said ill start\\u00a0with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she went what i said what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane went i dont know i said cancer i didnt do it so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist so id never say that in public so to anyone who mattered anyway so dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going it was transphobic it wasnt transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and thats the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target theyre not necessarily the same ill tell you the joke you make your minds up its live so they go your host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais theyre all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously its brilliant right so i just go relax im gonna be nice tonight ive changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously and i go\\u00a0now caitlyn jenner of course and what a year shes had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke ill tell you why right its layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes im playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying shes a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if shes a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car lets not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress thats the target of the joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a\\u00a0press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and one of the press said what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she went maybe i should host the golden globes and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously i just sent back let her host just dont let her drive another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying why is it transphobic they said its about a trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but im willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete\\u00a0he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big famous man with a huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was a man years ago im saying and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door the doctor went come in this is years ago id never deadname her now but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so like come in and he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then the doctor\\u2013 this was years ago the doctor went all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy and bruce jenner\\u2013 that was\\u00a0his name this is years ago right so bruce jenner went yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy and bruce jenner went\\u2013 that was his name bruce jenner went look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rules he uses his whole name every time for some reason come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate bruce jenner went no thats not my pole thats my enormous penis well seeing as its your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside and bruce jenner went that was his name for fiftyeight years i think he went no theyre not my shot puts doctor theyre my enormous testicles thats where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went oh yeah that makes perfect\\u2013 im a medical man youre a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy youre a big youre big and you would have a big old cock and balls theyre beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of them bruce bruce went this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them and the doctor went what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fucking driving for one thing so im engaging these people and im saying but i had to say her old name thats the joke i say ive changed not as much as bruce jenner then i do the joke but no this is my second crime i say she hasnt changed shes always identified\\u00a0as a woman that means shes a woman fine if thats the rules if you feel youre a woman you are im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i dont think its going far enough cause ive always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say im a chimp i am a chimp preop but dont ever deadname me dont call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo im gonna have species realignment im halfway there im short with short legs and long arms i stoop my backs getting hairier by the day ive got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like so i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say im a chimp ive got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy thatd be lovely im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp were so close than for a man to turn\\u00a0into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out into\\u2013 im not a doctor but that is the gist of it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but to me every single one of you is equal to a chimp so so id have all that done hair and that id do all that all the ill retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies im talking to jane shes going what is it what is it bobo you left the fucking oven on theres a fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally a chimp ill be well properly chimpedup ill be able to use chimp toilets ill be walking along holding janes hand come on bobo right we dont hold hands now i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp but well be all in love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo in love just two like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him and run up a tree and thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheers so humanity what is humanity what are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die now my sevenyearold niece didnt like hearing that but i said youve gotta learn stop crying i said youre seven you know today so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled so lets take the first of those birth its odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early thats why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb thats why were so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes im proper pregnant right im gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes mum its got to be fucking ready were were helpless right just think nine months were growing in this perfect environment everythings its like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass youre covered in shit theres screaming you go i cant breathe someone goes yes you fucking can the first one second of life\\u00a0on earth you dont know where you are you cant choose where youre born i was\\u00a0born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldnt have chosen that id have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took\\u00a0 years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous its a rarefied place its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i dont know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didnt get mugged or molested there werent many pedophiles\\u00a0in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god theres no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him bender it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasnt always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying hes out of touch hes so famous hes rich hes megarich i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like hes an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum and i say i say dont call them scum right but even the papers they try and get around to it i do interviews and theyll always say do you always fly first class i go no often private right the number of times ive answered this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk is to make you look out of touch i dont know but thats irrelevant next time a journalist asks me ill say i dont know but heres\\u00a0a grand run and get me one is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece theyre still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like you dont have children i say no why dont you have children which is an odd question why dont you have children as opposed to asking people why do you have children lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didnt even touch the sides or disturb her cigarette that one just go and claim for that people say its selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring\\u00a0a life into the world that doesnt exist on any level theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going we want to be born right but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children three main reasons and ill share them with you three reasons one theres millions the worlds overpopulated noones going ricks not having kids were gonna run out fuck two kids are scroungers arent they i mean from day one its all me me me isnt it feed me clothe me pay for my chemotherapy no no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they dont want to pay you back theyre not grateful they dont go thanks for having me its i didnt wanna be born even if they get a top job which they wont youll never see that money back theyll just put you in a home okay and my kid hed be born into ridiculous wealth wouldnt he so hed be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty im a little hampstead cunt yes i know these are my cunty friends i know its obvious i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that youre little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead first hed know he was a little hampstead cunt im a little yes we know everyone knows right hed know that right on the other hand hed know hed never live up to being as brilliant as his dad id say i worked my way up from nothing and youre just a useless hampstead cunt hed go yeah and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit eleven twelve hed be naughty run with the wrong crowd try and get out from under my shadow then hed turn to drugs about  hed come home and overdose on my afghan rug twenty grand that was right and as he was there convulsing and throwing up his fucking lungs right and with his little posh highpitched fucking death rattle his little fucking dying words hed go do you love me now daddy no no no i never did thats why youll never be born you useless fucking junkie hampstead cunt and three id worry sick about him you know no i would\\u00a0ive only got a cat now and i worry sick about her i check the door three times when i go out so she doesnt escape i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and shes peckish a human baby oh my god the responsibility of a human life id watch it sleep you know we said how weak and vulnerable they are oh my god you perfect little thing oh you flesh of my flesh now go to sleep in your expensive cot like that night night sleep tight dont let the bedbugs dead yeah just why why is it dead its just fucking dead look fucks sake fucking hell what the what a fucking waste of time that was fucks sake embarrassing jane what come here im in the shower come here what fucking dead already i didnt just fucking fucking hell jane you call that a baby that is if jane was out id have to text her wouldnt i what could you babys dead shed come back what the fuck id go yep forget the pampers lol but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables with their sharp edges id have to pad them so it didnt run into it cave its head in and die then social services come round and say is this your child mr gervais yeah what happened here then i go its a fucking idiot i did think of adopting for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three boxes one i wouldnt be adding to the population problem id be alleviating an existing problem a young kid born through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have died i can literally save his life and give him a great upbringing right two he would be grateful wouldnt he hed wanna pay me back woudnt he particularly if i let him know the\\u00a0other kids in the village werent so lucky they didnt they didnt make it out right id tell him that early on so he really bucked his ideas up id go tunde come here come here yeah yeah go and pop a shirt on youre not in africa now thats better yeah tunde look\\u2013 yeah water straight out of a tap innit yes yeah yeah no its not free its hampstead you know but yeah course its safe safe fresh drinking water have as much as you want have a bucket full fresh drinking water there you go go and clean the car go on no id go look remember all your friends in the village back in africa theyre all dead a rich man didnt save them and bring them to hampstead do you wanna pay me back yeah yeah i bet you do the good thing about them is they can start work when theyre about six i just call up nike and i go do you still make your stuff in sweatshops got a great little worker here yeah pound a days fine hes gotta start somewhere and three if he ran round and caved his head in and died and social services came round and said is this your child mr gervais id go does it look like mine id go this is hampstead its obviously broken in thats why i dont have kids even though i dont have children of my own people still show me photos of theirs like i give a shit i dont mean my own family theyve given up ive got older brothers and sisters theyve had loads of kids and their kids have kids and then their kids theres about  i dont know\\u00a0all their names i see them at christmas its all uncle ricky they know ive got a bit of cash they go through my pockets and then fuck off its like being mugged by mice right i dont mean them i mean strangers i could be busy i could be working like on the set of a tv or film or something stressed producing or directing it you get someone whos in for one day with one line or a stuntman they introduce themselves good be with you in a minute then they hover busy i go yeah yes yeah they go working the weekend i go not filming but ill be in the edit im taking my youngest to ballet lessons ah great great yeah shes eight ive got a photograph i go you know what show me it if she goes missing ill keep an eye open in the woods youve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole and go shes beautiful its gotta be long\\u00a0too short its awkward they know you go yeah right too long and its like shes shes fucking beautiful its a minefield innit so im not out of touch but i am spoiled theres a difference i didnt have any money until i was  ive got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesnt take much il give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time youre horrified everyones looking pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went wheres that bloke im not queueing its quick when i fly to the states ive got a place there but im always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesnt get any better even if i was paying id still go first class but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movies on shell love that shell be up for that but when someone else is paying i say jane get up here with me right front two seats they board us early were on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne its great its like a day off no phone or anything its like\\u00a0a holiday flying to the statesi could do without the safety video thats always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked youre going down the plane smashes you go ill try it you do that ball of flames you wake up everyones dead you go fucking hell thats amazing that is and they always use that voice dont they that calming hypnotic voice like nothing bad will happen theyre saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because im using this voice dont worry things like in the event of the plane landing on water\\u2013 it smashes the fuck to bits right they say in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyones dead except you by a miracle youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is youve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or youre eaten by a shark or you drown youre hoping theyve sent airsea rescue youre going god im\\u00a0gonna die i dont know what im doing hold on i mean air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever been\\u00a0in a helicopter o course you havent but theyre fucking loud its like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle its like like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that its brilliant right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais she goes off i go have you got\\u00a0any of them warm nuts she went were not handing out nuts on this flight a ladys getting on whos so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction i went oh my god of course i was fuming i mean whats that got to do with me why cant i eat nuts just cause fucking this woman will die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly its and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean i never wanted nuts more i felt she was\\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought oh i wish id brought my own nuts on right i thought for a second but that wouldnt work shed get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that and die and someone would go ricky gervais brought his own nuts on you know right so i dont take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case then i go can i have any nuts they go no sorry this lady would die yeah not a problem lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog i go whats the matter i touch her all over whats the matter she goes nuts right and dies and i go whos been eating nuts i get off scotfree so i got to america i went on a chat show tonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by outrage i mean one person going how dare you this woman goes i saw you on\\u00a0jimmy fallon making fun of nut allergies my daughters nutintolerant how dare you i go who is this woman shes tweeted  times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go whats this how many followers twentythree ignore it you know when youre being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going so you find so and so funny and cause the teachers really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever she said would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog yeah yeah you saying that yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and theyre talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause im this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies i should have left it right i sent back i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies she sent back yes\\u00a0but the holocaust didnt kill children well it did didnt it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies didnt kill children jesus it did kill children hitler killed  million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldnt make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but if i was throwing a dinner party and id been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more everyones enjoying it everything okay ja ist\\u00a0yummy right hes loving it i go cheers you fucker how you doing boy shes going i cant eat that fucking hell who wants ferrero rocher me all right here i cant eat them oh fuck off home rightthats what the worlds like people see something they dont like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about\\u00a0their thing as much as they do its why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think ive lived through the best  years of humanity  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now its going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe im not saying this because im old old people say things like oh everything was better when i was a kid course it was you were a kid everythings better when youre a kid being old is the shit bit whatevers happening being old is i wake up these days and i go oh fuck i didnt die gotta do it all again im usually hung over headache liver pains i cant walk for the first five minutes cause ive got no joints in my knees im getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about \\u00a0proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor and i was saying to jane im having a heart attack right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because id eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like python swallow a pig whole and then its just fucked its like itll sit there for a week its like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasnt having a heart attack but it worried jane she said you gotta look after yourself i thought youre right  so i started working out right every day i didnt give anything up i dont eat meat anymore but i was having   calories\\u00a0a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically cant\\u00a0burn off the calories i cant do enough cause im so old and broken and tired so im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die im losing my hair its getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right ill have to buzz that off soon id never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think youve got away with it you havent everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig\\u00a0has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party itll go theres a wig in here i go is there yes there is yeah spidey senses for the wig its obvious the way they smile like nothings wrong hiya its the telltale signs isnt it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke hes dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what is\\u2013 i was about eight i said to auntie edna what happened she went it was a miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he wouldnt do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we werent allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said reg is allergic to balloons he wasnt allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room weve got photos in the family album if hes at a wedding or a christening and hes holding a baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasnt scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows the chemo going uncle not a problem weve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it hes wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared and it was a shock to me i only found out recently ill share it with you now the distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years as a young man they were pert and now theyre like two plums in a sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just and this is how i found out so as ive been getting older and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them and theyd sink you know most people never see their in the sea youre in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked in hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on the bottom theyre on top whats going on right and i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact theyd created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle im just thinking this is bizarre fucking hell right and i thought maybe its a fluke so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them and now in this posttruth era people dont care about the argument they say whos saying the argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now its my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe the earth is  years old i believe youre a fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didnt want to make a mistake and theres a ridiculous thing of lets ask the average person what they think lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but its not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you the news i saw a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said weve looked at everything and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so were going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but the guy went we asked the public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay \\u00a3 a year so im not happy the next one said it takes me  minutes each way its not good enough the last one said i say its better to arrive at work late than dead why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted youre in early ted oh ted weve been through this remember i said id rather you arrive late than dead but the big enemy is stupidity right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyones opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say its fine to be an atheist its fine to believe in god and its fine not to thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this is a tweet i got\\u00a0after one of those and it was all in capitals which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes a gentleman from texas hes a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then hes remember its in capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science\\u2013 my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard the word he took a guess never seen it written down because its not in the bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days youre not gonna say to him do you believe in satan and have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong and i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what what is wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan and hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do\\u00a0all the good stuff which you want i mean you do want\\u2013 yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass and hes got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes a fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh my god im in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped and goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it is he his days suddenly got a little bit brighter and like hes not next right so im getting raped right by the devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum and im like that yeah whatever i assume it happens all eternity yeah yeah whatever like that i might say watch your hooves on my testicles and hed go why are they so distended and i go oh like youre brad pitt you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we you lying fucking atheist hes probably bored fucking atheists every fucking day right his little gargoyle comes up satan he goes what and i go yeah what he goes theres a fundamentalist christian fuck this hed be on him like a ton of bricks so i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going ah loser and hes fighting back really witlessly saying things like go fuck your sister you english faggot that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again its still all going off right its really funny im laughing at all the replies people saying things to him im scrolling down theres one tweet directly to me from this woman she says you find rape funny no no what no your mates find rape funny no listen right you find rape funny listen everyone listen right no i said to her i didnt tweet that she went you retweeted it to show hes an idiot but you must find it funny or amusing its not a frivolous thing i said no well its up to him isnt it he can do it now im arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didnt say what you find jokes about rape funny she said what you find rape funny the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on the joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on the joke its about context\\u00a0its about content what do you mean by a rape joke she said even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what the joke is i tweeted that clip of me in the office going i think theres been a rape up there everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said\\u00a0some jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play\\u00a0on words that dont really mean anything a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it ill tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says help ive been graped the policeman says do you mean raped she says no there was a bunch of them that is a rape joke right so and i even said to her no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes\\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting id never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying well okay i see your point but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it when noone in the audience has been raped i should have left it i just sent back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says can i just ask you a question yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you cant come in what why a lady says she wont laugh if youre in off you go thats what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally thats like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons and you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing in twitters defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tescos or something thats the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about the kids in syria what well im not giving you a choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back in the hole theres a bull here and theres one thing that i didnt want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and its horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back its a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people dont really read it its a kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs and cows in the west yep we do i dont but yeah i used to youre right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog its not about the species its what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its the worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got to tweet that i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said is that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death she said i just hate the cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not the point ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor mans will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and hed get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought hed won the argument and hed tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought if it looked\\u00a0respectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read is that pedophile postman still reading your mail and shed take it shed go in and shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right wed never been to church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said to bob tell me about your mum so i can say a few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said well she was a keen racist the vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying to get\\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didnt warn us and he did get something by the vicar so were called ricky robert\\u2013 bob\\u2013 ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out hes a standup guy larry so bob gives the vicar the wrong name didnt warn us were all in church start of the funeral were all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and we snort like that right bobs going everyone realizes were all laughing we see larry go all right and the church is like every time we thought of it wed see larry go like that right then wed just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicars thinking what have i said right hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying id come prepared with a pack of tissues theyd take one and hand it on before the funeral id taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said snivelling fucking bitch and theyre sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all\\u00a0started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said sorry was that okay me and bob went\\u00a0fucking brilliant\\u00a0mate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were all\\u00a0gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity youre bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny youve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right so were all in the car one day bobs driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and theres a british bobby there and he stops the car bobs at the window he said where are we off to bob went bognor he went\\u00a0can you just pop the boot please so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bobs window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes and the copper went bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets and bob went i knew it wasnt fucking brains youve been amazing good night prolefeed your email address will not be
